N2  - Early diagnosis and treatment of parasitic diseases are indispensable to combat parasites mediated morbidity and mortality in humans and animals. Mammalian sourced antibodies are being successfully used in immunotherapy and immunoassays. However, their increased conservation amongst mammals, involves them in unnecessary interaction and immune mediated pathologies, obstructing their applications in certain approaches in immunoassays. Further, the high production cost and difficulty to achieve high and stable antibody titer hampers their utility for therapeutic purposes. In recent years, chicken egg yolk immunoglobulin, termed as immunoglobulin Y (IgY) has attracted noticeable consideration since it poses greater advantages than mammalian IgG including high yield, low cost and convenience. IgY has unique properties which are being exploited in different aspects for its applications in research, diagnosis and therapy. This review gives an overview of the research outcomes pertaining to chicken IgY as diagnostics and therapeutics in parasitology.

N2  - Water is one of the possible transmission routes for water- and foodborne parasites to humans. Echinococcus multilocularis is a parasite, which causes alveolar echinococcosis (AE). Nevertheless, no environmental studies have been performed as yet to confirm the occurrence of E. multilocularis in water supplies. Accordingly, 105 water samples of 50 L volume were collected from surface waters (lakes, rivers, canals) and wells in the Warmia-Masuria Province (Echinococcus endemic area) and Pomerania Province (Echinococcus non-endemic area), Poland. The water was filtered and subsequently analysed with nested PCR and real-time PCR. E. multilocularis DNA was found in two (1.9%) samples, which originated from two lakes localised in the Warmia-Masuria Province. Sequencing of the positive samples confirmed that the PCR products were fragments of the E. multilocularis mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene. This is the first investigation describing E. multilocularis detection in environmental water samples, using molecular diagnostic tools. The results indicate that water could be considered as a potential source of E. multilocularis infections in humans and animals, in endemic areas.

N2  - Diagnosis of cystic echinococcosis (CE) is at present mainly based on imaging techniques. Serology has a complementary role, partly due to the small number of standardized and commercially available assays. Therefore we examined the clinical performance of the SERION ELISA classic Echinococcus IgG test. Using 10 U/ml as a cut-off point, and serum samples from 50 CE patients and 105 healthy controls, the sensitivity and specificity were 98.0% and 96.2%, respectively. If patients with other infectious diseases were used as negative controls, the specificity decreased to 76.9%, which causes poor positive predictive values. However, if results between 10 and 15 U/ml are classified as indecisive, the specificity of positive results (≥15 U/ml) increased to 92.5% without greatly affecting the sensitivity (92.0%). Using this approach in combination with imaging studies, the SERION ELISA classic Echinococcosis IgG test can be a useful aid in the diagnosis of CE.

N2  - A 72-year-old female status post renal transplant presenting with right hemiparesis, expressive aphasia, and weight loss was found to have a left frontal ring-enhancing lesion with associated vasogenic edema. Imaging was most concerning for high-grade glioma, gliomatosis cerebri with anaplastic transformation, vs solitary metastasis and less concerning for evolving intraparenchymal hemorrhage, abscess, tuberculoma, or fungal granuloma. Maximal safe resection was not feasible. Awaiting stereotactic biopsy results, plans for palliative chemoradiotherapy for presumed glioblastoma were initiated. Frozen pathology review suggested high-grade glioma but ultimate diagnosis of cerebral toxoplasmosis was made. Patient started sulfadiazine, pyrimethamine, and leucovorin. This case identifies an uncommon presentation of cerebral toxoplasmosis whose definitive pathological diagnosis was indispensable to preservation of life. It serves as a critical example of the importance of maintaining a wide differential, as a patient with presumed aggressive terminal cancer was diagnosed with a treatable parasitic infection. We share perspectives from neurosurgery, medical-oncology, radiation-oncology, and infectious disease specialists regarding diagnosis and management. We highlight atypical presentations of cerebral toxoplasmosis, emphasize differential diagnoses, and promote obtaining tissue diagnosis in guiding medical decision making of ring enhancing lesions.

N2  - Schistosoma mansoni is a long-lived intravascular trematode parasite that can infect humans causing the chronic debilitating disease, schistosomiasis. We hypothesize that the action of host-interactive proteins found at the schistosome surface allows the worms to maintain a safe, anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory environment around them in the bloodstream. One such protein is the ˜60 kDa alkaline phosphatase SmAP which is known to be expressed in the outer tegument of all intravascular life stages. We demonstrate in this work that the parasites (schistosomula as well as adult males and females) can hydrolyze polyphosphate (polyP) - an anionic, linear polymer of inorganic phosphates that is produced and released by immune cells as well as by activated platelets and that induce proinflammatory and prothrombotic pathways. Purified recombinant SmAP can likewise cleave polyP and with a Km of 6.9 ± 1 mM. Finally, parasites whose SmAP gene has been suppressed by RNAi are significantly impaired in their ability to hydrolyze polyP. SmAP-mediated cleavage of polyP may contribute to the armamentarium of schistosomes that promotes their survival in the hostile intravascular habitat. This is the first report of any pathogen cleaving this bioactive metabolite.

N2  - Prolactin (PRL)is a pleiotropic polypeptide hormone produced by the anterior pituitary gland and negatively controlled by dopamine. Some researchers have associated the immune regulatory functions of PRL with some infectious diseases like Toxoplasma gondii and T. cruzi. This work aimed to analyze the possible immuno-modulatory effects of this hormone through the subcutaneous administration of PRL during the experimental Chagas disease. On the 14th day post-infection (dpi), PRL triggered increased percentages of NK cells in treated infected animals as compared to the infected and untreated ones. For early and late apoptosis, our results showed that in chronically infected groups, PRL counteracted splenocyte apoptosis as revealed by the reduced percentages of both, early and late apoptosis. Reduced percentages of spleen CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were detected in infected PRL treated rats (60 days post-infection). Concerning to B cells, a significant increased percentage of these cells was found for all PRL treated infected animals (14th dpi), but no statistically significant alteration was observed on the 60th days post-infection. Furthermore, PRL treatment triggered a significant increase in the percentage of CD4+ T lymphocytes IFN-γ producers, while on the 60th dpi, a reduced percentage of IFN-γ in these cells was observed in prolactin-treated rats compared to infected and untreated ones. Enhanced serum IL-12 levels were detected in infected and PRL treated subjects (60th dpi). Only on 7th day post-infection, the flow cytometric analysis of CFSE-stained CD3+ T cells showed an enhanced proliferation of polyclonal stimulated T cells in PRL-treated and infected animals. In this study, we demonstrated that PRL can influence many aspects of the immune response during the experimental Chagas' disease, and this substance could be used as a supporting trial along with the conventional drug treatment.

N2  - Co-ordination between innate and adaptive immunity is a foremost crucial immunological interactions. The interaction is beneficial for the survival of the host against infectious agent and also detrimental for the pathogen during their future encounter. Major cellular components to bridge the gap of innate and adaptive immune system include B cells, varieties of T cell subsets and their interaction with antigen presenting cells. T cells are the components of immune system which recognise antigen that are specifically presented with the different class of MHC molecules like MHCI and MHCII marking the diversity of exogenous and endogenous nature of antigen. T cells further differentiate in varieties of morphological and immunological forms like CD4+, CD8+ T cells, Th-17, Treg and γδ-T cells based on the nature of antigen, interaction and polarizing factors. Therefore the evolutionary selections of these diversities have a different functional aspect which is not only dependent upon their percentage presence but more promisingly dependent upon their physiological state and local environment. Thus this review is highlighting the major contributions of T cells subsets using an infectious disease model of visceral leishmaniasis and also helpful in explaining the reason for the non-responsiveness of the T cells subsets during the onset and progression of infection.

N2  - The protozoan hemoflagellate, Leishmania martiniquensis, is the causative agent of cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis among humans. This parasite was first isolated from an autochthonous case of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Martinique Island (French West Indies) in 1995 and its taxonomical position was later established in 2002. At present, the emergence of this globally infectious disease caused by L.martiniquensis raises serious concerns and has gained attention from the national public health policy. Epidemiological studies indicated that Thailand is one of the endemic areas of L.martiniquensis with hundreds of cases, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, have been reported among patients positive for HIV/AIDS. Information on its basic biology including suitable conditions for parasite propagation is limited. To assess this, we used four established media, that is, Medium 199 (M199), RPMI 1640 medium (RPMI), Grace's insect medium (GIM), and Schneider's insect medium (SIM) to investigate the promastigote growth by evaluating the growth characteristics, viability, and kinetics of stage differentiation in each medium. The findings from this study showed that parasites growing in different media exhibited different biological characteristics, which would be suitable for very specific research purposes, i.e., RPMI; for long term parasite maintenance, M199; for mass culture of parasites, M199 and GIM; for initial isolation of the parasites in clinical specimens, and SIM; for metacyclogenesis study.

N2  - Globally, human health is improving. Aggregate world health data indicate enormous improvement over the last 100 years. Life expectancy, vaccination, and sanitation rates are higher. Rates of infectious disease, HIV/AIDS, child and maternal mortality are lower. These gains have all been accomplished during a time when governments orchestrated, or aspired to provide, albeit often imperfectly, the systemizations of health care. Now austerity and privatization campaigns shape health services worldwide, and we witness a massive ideological shift in approaches to the world’s wickedest health problems: Public health endeavors must ‘show return on investment.’ This commentary takes up activities in three health domains where effort goes into the appearance of global health prowess and accomplishment: health security; health innovation; and health finance. Pseudo global health, as an analytic, helps us take measure of the in-between phenomenon between real and fake accomplishment, success and failure, improved health outcomes and continued suffering. I show: 1) how global health security documents sometimes serve as ‘alibis’–that is, contrivances offered to intimate local readiness or safety despite their actual absence; 2) how global health innovation influencers often privilege tech-fixes developed far removed from real-time people, places, and practices; and 3) how global health finance has already evolved in ways that makes suffering profitable. The examples are meant to enlighten rather than depress and are offered with the hope that critical analyses using the pseudo health concept as an analytic prompt new strategies for sustainable changes rather than merely their appearance.

N2  - In March 2017, a captive male juvenile (ca. 6 months old) olive baboon (Papio anubis) was brought to a primate rescue center in Benin with multiple subcutaneous swellings of unknown aetiology. At the general inspection of the body, around 15 partially mobile masses of variable sizes were found in different locations across the body. Following two surgical procedures, several cyst-like structures were removed and placed either in 10% formalin or in absolute ethanol. The cysts had a typical coenurus-like morphology. Genomic DNA was extracted from one cyst using a commercially available kit. The molecular characterization was performed by PCR amplification and sequencing of a region of the nuclear ITS-2 rDNA and a fragment of the mitochondrial 12S rDNA gene, revealing its identity as T. serialis, with 88%–98% similarity to T. serialis isolates from USA, Japan and Germany This study reports a new host for the larval form of T. serialis and confirms the role of primates as intermediate host, highlighting also the risk for human infection. Further genetic studies from multiple geographic isolates are needed to clarify the taxonomic status of this group.

N2  - Toxoplasma gondii is a widely distributed zoonotic protozoan parasite, which can affect most warm-blooded species. Some species of non-human primates (NHPs)are highly susceptible to T. gondii infection. The aim of the study was to determine the seroprevalence and risk factors associated with T. gondii infection in NHPs housed in zoos in Spain. Sera from 189 NHPs belonging to 33 species were collected in eight zoos. Additionally, 10 of the 189 animals were longitudinally sampled. Anti-T. gondii antibodies were detected in 48 NHPs (25.4%; confidence interval of 95% (CI95%): 19.2–31.6)using a modified agglutination test (MAT; cut-off = 25). Seropositive animals had titers of 25 (6.3%), 50 (8.3%), 100 (8.3%)and ≥500 (68.8%). Seropositivity was detected in 15 of the 33 species (45.5%). Of the 10 NHPs sampled more than once, two animals (one Barbary macaque [Macaca sylvanus]and one common chimpanzee [Pan toglodytes])seroconverted along the study period, while one seropositive chimpanzee increased antibody titers over time. The Hominidae family (OR = 5.9; CI95%: 2.7–12.8)and sex (females)(OR = 2.1; CI95%: 1.1–4.1)were risk factors potentially associated with seropositivity to T. gondii. Our results evince a widespread circulation of T. gondii in NHPs in zoos in Spain, which may be of conservation concern. Control measures should be implemented to minimize the risk of exposure of these species to T. gondii.

N2  - Anthelmintic resistance is a threat to global food security. In order to alleviate the selection pressure for resistance and maintain drug efficacy, management strategies increasingly aim to preserve a proportion of the parasite population in ‘refugia’, unexposed to treatment. While persuasive in its logic, and widely advocated as best practice, evidence for the ability of refugia-based approaches to slow the development of drug resistance in parasitic helminths is currently limited. Moreover, the conditions needed for refugia to work, or how transferable those are between parasite-host systems, are not known. This review, born of an international workshop, seeks to deconstruct the concept of refugia and examine its assumptions and applicability in different situations. We conclude that factors potentially important to refugia, such as the fitness cost of drug resistance, the degree of mixing between parasite sub-populations selected through treatment or not, and the impact of parasite life-history, genetics and environment on the population dynamics of resistance, vary widely between systems. The success of attempts to generate refugia to limit anthelmintic drug resistance are therefore likely to be highly dependent on the system in hand. Additional research is needed on the concept of refugia and the underlying principles for its application across systems, as well as empirical studies within systems that prove and optimise its usefulness.

N2  - Cystoisosporosis is a leading diarrheal disease in suckling piglets. With the confirmation of resistance against the only available drug toltrazuril, there is a substantial need for novel therapeutics to combat the infection and its negative effects on animal health. In closely related apicomplexan species, bumped kinase inhibitors (BKIs) targeting calcium-dependent protein kinase 1 (CDPK1) were shown to be effective in inhibiting host-cell invasion and parasite growth. Therefore, the gene coding for Cystoisospora suis CDPK1 (CsCDPK1) was identified and cloned to investigate activity and thermal stabilization of the recombinant CsCDPK1 enzyme by BKI 1369. In this comprehensive study, the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of BKI 1369 in piglets experimentally infected with Cystoisospora suis (toltrazuril-sensitive, Wien-I and toltrazuril-resistant, Holland-I strains) were determined in vivo and in vitro using an established animal infection model and cell culture, respectively. BKI 1369 inhibited merozoite proliferation in intestinal porcine epithelial cells-1 (IPEC-1) by at least 50% at a concentration of 40 nM, and proliferation was almost completely inhibited (>95%) at 200 nM. Nonetheless, exposure of infected cultures to 200 nM BKI 1369 for five days did not induce structural alterations in surviving merozoites as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy. Five-day treatment with BKI 1369 (10 mg/kg BW twice a day) effectively suppressed oocyst excretion and diarrhea and improved body weight gains in treated piglets without obvious side effects for both toltrazuril-sensitive, Wien-I and resistant, Holland-I C. suis strains. The plasma concentration of BKI 1369 in piglets increased to 11.7 μM during treatment, suggesting constant drug accumulation and exposure of parasites to the drug. Therefore, oral applications of BKI 1369 could potentially be a therapeutic alternative against porcine cystoisosporosis. For use in pigs, future studies on BKI 1369 should be directed towards ease of drug handling and minimizing treatment frequencies.

N2  - Working equids are used in different countries for numerous purposes and regularly are crucial for multiple communities' income and profit. Historically, in Bogotá D.C. they were used as animal-powered vehicles but in 2013 it was initiated a substitution and adoption program as a result of society pressure and lawful processes. Infectious diseases and mainly parasitic diseases, poses a threat in the health and productivity of these animals. Our aim was to identify, by coproparasitological methods, the gastrointestinal and pulmonary parasite species infecting working horses submitted to the mentioned substitution and adoption program. Between May and December 2013 and February and July 2014, fresh faecal samples were obtained from 1004 and 648 horses from Bogotá D.C. and other Colombian municipalities, respectively. They were processed by flotation and Baermann tests in order to visualize faecal parasitic forms (eggs, oocysts, and larvae). Prevalences were calculated for each gastrointestinal parasite at origin and one year after, at destination, and analysed by age group and coinfection. At origin (Bogotá D.C.), prevalence for at least one parasite species was 87.5% and one year later, at destination (other municipalities), was 89.5%. The most prevalent species were strongyles (86.4–89.4%) followed by Parascaris spp. (0.7–6.2%), cestodes (Anoplocephalidae) (3.7–4.9%) and Oxyuris sp. (2.8–4.3%). Other species detected were Eimeria sp., Strongyloides sp. and Dictyocaulus sp. Coinfection by two or more species ranged between 14.4 and 38.3% being strongyle, Parascaris spp., Oxyuris sp. and cestodes (Anoplocephalidae) the most common species involved. Some parasitic infections commonly associated with younger animals (e.g. Parascaris spp.) were detected in all age groups. Flow patterns of parasites linking Bogotá D.C. and other municipalities are presented. Finally, these results support the widespread distribution of most of species and the plausible health and welfare impact of this infections in working equids submitted to particular epidemiological risks.

N2  - Studies of vertebrate immunity have traditionally focused on professional cells, including circulating and tissue-resident leukocytes. Evidence that non-professional cells are also intrinsically essential (i.e. not via their effect on leukocytes) for protective immunity in natural conditions of infection has emerged from three lines of research in human genetics. First, studies of Mendelian resistance to infection have revealed an essential role of DARC-expressing erythrocytes in protection against Plasmodium vivax infection, and an essential role of FUT2-expressing intestinal epithelial cells for protection against norovirus and rotavirus infections. Second, studies of inborn errors of non-hematopoietic cell-extrinsic immunity have shown that APOL1 and complement cascade components secreted by hepatocytes are essential for protective immunity to trypanosome and pyogenic bacteria, respectively. Third, studies of inborn errors of non-hematopoietic cell-intrinsic immunity have suggested that keratinocytes, pulmonary epithelial cells, and cortical neurons are essential for tissue-specific protective immunity to human papillomaviruses, influenza virus, and herpes simplex virus, respectively. Various other types of genetic resistance or predisposition to infection in human populations are not readily explained by inborn variants of genes operating in leukocytes and may, therefore, involve defects in other cells. The probing of this unchartered territory by human genetics is reshaping immunology, by scaling immunity to infection up from the immune system to the whole organism.

N2  - Small ruminants are important to community livelihood in developing countries; however information on the role of hemoprotozoan parasites is scanty. The objective of the study was to determine hemoprotozoan parasitic prevalence in western Uganda and identify major areas associated with these infections. This was a cross sectional study conducted at the edge of Budongo Conservation Forest in Masindi district of western Uganda in which 712 small ruminants were sampled. Blood from the jugular vein was collected from caprines and ovines and placed in an EDTA tube, and transported to the laboratory for examination. Thin and thick smears were prepared and examined by microscopy for hemoprotozoan parasites, and DNA was extracted and examined by PCR for Trypanosoma spp. A total of 13 villages in Budongo sub-county were surveyed and the study showed that caprines were the major small ruminants of importance to the community. Prevalence of hemoprotozoan parasites was as follows; anaplasmosis (3.65%) > theileriosis (0.45%) > trypanosomiasis (0.15%) and babesiosis (0%) by microscopy. Infections were found in the young with the exception of Anaplasma spp. while coinfections of anaplasmosis and theileriosis were high. Molecular analysis showed an overall trypanosome prevalence of 9.27% (PCR), mainly due to Trypanosoma brucei and T. congolense forest. Villages with trypanosomiasis were found in lowlands and swamps. The current trypanosomiasis prevalence in small ruminants of Uganda was 10 times greater than that previously reported showing that the disease burden has increased overtime within Uganda. A prevalence of 0.14% (95% CI: 0.00, 0.78) for the SRA gene showed that small ruminants would be important reservoirs of infection to humans. Hemoprotozoan parasites are a threat to community livelihood in developing countries and the role of molecular diagnostic techniques in disease monitoring was re-emphasized by this study. Information on primary hosts involved in the propagation of hemoprotozoan parasites in Uganda would help streamline prospective disease surveillance and control efforts.

N2  - A total of 476 European isolates (310 Cryptococcus neoformans var. grubii, 150 C. neoformans var. neoformans, and 16 C. gattii species complex) from both clinical and environmental sources were analyzed by multi-locus sequence typing. Phylogenetic and population genetic analyses were performed. Sequence analysis identified 74 sequence types among C. neoformans var. neoformans (VNIV), 65 among C. neoformans var. grubii (56 VNI, 8 VNII, 1 VNB), and 5 among the C. gattii species complex (4 VGI and 1 VGIV) isolates. ST23 was the most frequent genotype (22%) among VNI isolates which were mostly grouped in a large clonal cluster including 50% of isolates. Among VNIV isolates, a predominant genotype was not identified. A high percentage of autochthonous STs were identified in both VNI (71%) and VNIV (96%) group of isolates. The 16 European C. gattii species complex isolates analyzed in the present study originated all from the environment and all belonged to a large cluster endemic in the Mediterranean area. Population genetic analysis confirmed that VNI group of isolates were characterized by low variability and clonal expansion while VNIV by a higher variability and a number of recombination events. However, when VNI and VNIV environmental isolates were compared, they showed a similar population structure with a high percentage of shared mutations and the absence of fixed mutations. Also linkage disequilibrium analysis reveals differences between clinical and environmental isolates showing a key role of PLB1 allele combinations in host infection as well as the key role of LAC1 allele combinations for survival of the fungus in the environment. The present study shows that genetic comparison of clinical and environmental isolates represents a first step to understand the genetic characteristics that cause the shift of some genotypes from a saprophytic to a parasitic life style.

N2  - Unawareness of canine parasitic diseases among at-risk hosts and an uncontrolled program of stray dog population have caused that zoonotic parasites received great attention in endemic regions of the Middle East. A total of 552 faecal samples were collected between December 2016 to January 2018 from stray (n = 408) and domestic (n = 144) dogs of Iran. All specimens were coproscopically observed following concentration and flotation techniques. Subsequently, the DNAs of taeniid eggs were extracted, amplified, and sequenced by targeting of mitochondrial cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 and small-subunit ribosomal DNA markers. The overall prevalence of canine intestinal parasites found 53.6%. The following parasites and their total frequencies were identified: taeniid (10.5%), Dicrocoelium dendriticum (0.7%), Trichuris vulpis (1.2%), Capillaria spp. (2.3%), Blastocystis spp. (5.2%), Ancylostoma spp. (2%), Eimeria spp. (13.2%), Dipylidium caninum (2.3%), Toxocara canis (3.8%), Giardia spp. (8.5%), and Toxascaris leonina (3.6%). Stray dogs were characterized more likely to be poliparasitized and indicated a higher prevalence of taeniid (10.9%), T. canis (4.4%) Giardia spp. (10.1%) than domestic dogs (P > 0.05). Phylogenetic and sequence analysis of Cox1 and SSU-rDNA indicated a low genetic diversity (Haplotype diversity; 0 to 0.495) in E. granulosus sensu lato G1, G3, G7 genotypes, and Taenia hydatigena. The pairwise sequence distances between G7 isolates showed an intra-diversity of 0.7%–1.5% and identity of 98.5%–100%. The first occurrence of pig strain (G7) from Iranian dogs might have substantial implications in the drug treatment of infected dogs due to the shorter maturation time of G7 compared with G1 genotype. Thus, the preventive strategies should be noticed to determine the risk factors, the importance of applying the hygienic practices, and well adjusting deworming programs for the Iranian dogs and at-risk individuals.

N2  - In the past decade, Toxoplasma gondii infection has been recognized as a potential risk for many psychiatric and neurological disorders. We performed this systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association between Toxoplasma infection and Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases. PubMed, Web of science, Scopus and Embase databases were searched up to September 30, 2018 for studies that reported risk of Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases associated with Toxoplasma infection. We used a random effects meta-analysis model to generate the pooled odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Eleven studies, including seven studies for Parkinson's disease (428 patients and 540 controls) and four studies for Alzheimer's disease (301 patients and 313 controls), were included in the meta-analysis. We found that there was no statistically significant association between Toxoplasma infection, as determined by IgG serology, IgM serology, and PCR with increased risk of Parkinson's disease (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.78–1.68), (OR, 1.61; 95% CI, 0.33–7.76) and (OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 0.43–8.05), respectively. The OR for association of Toxoplasma infection, based on IgG serology with Alzheimer's patients, compared to control group, was (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.99–1.92), demonstrating a marginally significant association between Toxoplasma infection and Alzheimer's disease. Our findings do not support a general hypotheses regarding an associative relationship between Toxoplasma infection and Parkinson's disease, but do support a marginally significant association between Toxoplasma infection and Alzheimer's disease; this association should be investigated further through longitudinal and experimental studies.

N2  - Toxoplasma gondii is an intracellular zoonotic parasite that causes toxoplasmosis, which can cause economic losses and serious public health problems worldwide. A member of the T. gondii calcium-dependent protein kinases family, TgCDPK1 was recently identified as an essential regulator of exocytosis in T. gondii, and participated in direct parasite motility, host-cell invasion and egress. In the present study, the protective immunity of recombinant TgCDPK1 protein (rTgCDPK1) was evaluated against acute toxoplasmosis in mice. rTgCDPK1 were expressed and purified, BABL/c mice were intraperitoneally immunized with rTgCDPK1 and challenged with the highly virulent RH strain of T. gondii. The specific immune responses were analyzed by measuring the cytokine and serum antibody, and lymphocyte proliferation assays, flow cytometry of lymphocytes and the survival curve were employed to evaluate the protective efficacy. From the results we found that special humoral and cellular responses could be elicited in vaccine mice, and higher level of IgG antibody, and the significant increased levels of Th1-type cytokines IFN-γ, IL-12 (p70), IL10 and CD3+CD4+CD8− and CD3+CD8+CD4− T cells could also be detected comparing to control mice (P < 0.05). All vaccinated mice prolonged survival time (14.90 ± 2.89 days) challenge with 1000 tachyzoites of RH, while the control mice died within 8 days. These results indicated that TgCDPK1 protein was a potential vaccine candidate against acute toxoplasmosis.

N2  - Feline leishmaniasis (FeL) is an emerging infectious disease of cats caused by Leishmania infantum with global distribution. This study investigated the cause of chronic progressive cutaneous lesions in two cats from Central-west Brazil by using cytological, histopathologic, and immunohistochemical (IHC) analyses. Clinically, both cats had ulcerative cutaneous lesions at the nasal planum and ear resulting in a tentative diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Moreover, both cats had varying degrees of onychogryphosis. However, cytology revealed chronic inflammatory reactions associated with intralesional amastigotes; histopathology confirmed chronic ulcerative dermatitis associated with intralesional and intracytoplasmic parasitic organisms consistent with amastigotes of Leishmania spp. within histiocytes. The IHC assay demonstrated that the intralesional parasitic structures identified by cytology and histopathology were immunoreactive to antigens of Leishmania spp., confirming the participation of this infectious disease agent in the development of the cutaneous lesions of these cats. The observation of onychogryphosis must be highlighted, since this lesion is frequently observed in dogs with visceral leishmaniasis but is underreported in FeL. Collectively, the pathologic and IHC findings of the chronic cutaneous disease confirmed active infections due to Leishmania spp. in these cats. Additionally, FeL with associated lesions to the ear and nasal planum must be considered as differential diagnosis for SCC in cats.

N2  - Abstract Farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) is one of the most economically important aquaculture species worldwide. Expansion has increased rapidly since the 1980s, and the subsequent industrial scale of production has led to numerous infectious diseases afflicting the marine grow-out stage. Amoebic gill disease (AGD) is a parasitic disease that was first recorded in Tasmania in 1989 and subsequently in Scotland in 2012, and is characterized by raised white lesions on the gills, with high mortality if left untreated. Current treatment methods primarily consist of freshwater or chemical treatment, and it is often necessary to repeat these treatments for the duration of the marine stage due to regular reinfection. To date, most research on analysis of the immune responses elicited has focused on salmon gene expression after first infection, or alternatively after numerous repeated infection/treatment cycles. This study has compared gene expression in gill and head kidney tissue during early infection (up to 15 days) with early reinfection (up to 14 days) post a single reinfection after hydrogen peroxide treatment. Multivariate analysis of the global transcript expression of a panel of ∼40 immune genes showed that in the gill tissue, prior to hydrogen peroxide treatment, pro-inflammatory pathways were stimulated, whereas after treatment, anti-microbial peptides were more highly expressed. In the head kidney, differences between pre and post-treatment sampling points were limited, with the most pronounced changes between 15 days post infection, and 1 day post treatment. This model of reinfection allows differences in the expression of an array of genes between pre and post treatment to be elucidated, and improves our knowledge of how the salmon immune system responds to multiple rounds of AGD infection.

N2  - Hydatid cyst commonly affects liver followed by lung, but rarely affects may be found in almost any organ simultaneously. We present an unusual case of disseminated pulmonary hydatidosis and its imaging features before medical therapy. Diagnosis was confirmed by pathologic findings and positive response to antihelminthic drugs.

N2  - Human giardiasis is a common waterborne/foodborne parasitic disease worldwide, especially in developing countries. Prevalence and molecular identity of Giardia parasites are largely controversial. The present study was conducted to determine the occurrence of Giardia parasites and the genetic profile of circulating assemblage(s) in patients attended the outpatient clinic at Kafrelsheikh University hospital, Kafr El Sheikh Province, Egypt. A total of 318 patients, of different age and sex, referred to the clinic were subjected to fecal examination. Microscopic results revealed that 181/318 (56.9%) were positive for Giardia parasites. Multilocus genotyping by PCR/sequencing of beta-giardin (bg), triose phosphate isomerase (tpi), and glutamate dehydrogenase (gdh) genes of representative number of positive samples (65) revealed that assemblages A, B and mixed infections (A + B) occurred in 26/65 (40.0%), 32/65 (49.2%) and 10.8% (7/65) of the analyzed isolates, respectively. MLGs analysis indicated that assemblage A sequences clustered in two novel types of AII sub-assemblage. In assemblage B sequences, BIII was the predominant (22/23, 95.7%) sub-assemblage compared to BIV (1/23, 4.3%). Collectively, assemblage B MLGs displayed greater levels of genetic diversity compared to assemblage A. Our data indicate that assemblages A and B of G. duodenalis circulate in humans at Kafr El Sheikh Province, Egypt, and that high genetic diversity exists at the assemblage and/or sub-assemblage levels.

N2  - Both oxidative stress and alterations in adenosinergic and cholinergic systems participate in initiation and progression of parasitic infectious diseases. Nevertheless, the involvement of these pathways during eimeriosis remains poorly understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the involvement of adenosinergic and cholinergic systems in regulation of inflammatory response and oxidative stress in chicken chicks experimentally infected with Eimeria spp. Two groups were formed for comparison at 3 time points (days 5, 10 and 15) of infection (PI): uninfected (control) and infected. Erythrocyte counts, hematocrit and hemoglobin levels were lower in infected chicks on day 15 post-infection (PI). Total leukocytes, heterophil and lymphocyte counts were higher in infected chicks on days 5 and 10 PI, while eosinophil counts were higher only on day 10 PI. Serum levels of total protein and globulins were higher in infected chicks on days 10 and 15 PI, while triglycerides and cholesterol levels were lower on day 15 PI. Acetylcholinesterase activity in total blood and butyrylcholinesterase activity in serum were higher in infected chicks on day 15 PI, while adenosine deaminase activity was higher on day 10 PI and lower on day 15 PI compared with the respective control. Finally, serum levels of reactive oxygen species and catalase activity in total blood were higher in infected chicks on day 15 PI, while superoxide dismutase activity in total blood was lower at the same time of infection. These data suggest that cholinergic and adenosinergic systems display a pro-inflammatory profile that contributes to impairment of immune and inflammatory responses in a mixed Eimeria infection. Furthermore, oxidative stress may contribute to clinical signs of disease as well as to pathogenesis. In summary, the impairment of immune response and alterations in blood antioxidant/oxidant status contributes to disease pathophysiology.

N2  - In animal model of experimental cerebral malaria (ECM), the genesis of neuropathology is associated with oxidative stress and inflammatory mediators. There is limited progress in the development of new approaches to the treatment of cerebral malaria. Here, we tested whether oral supplementation of Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) would offer protection against oxidative stress and brain associated inflammation following Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) infection in C57BL/6 J mouse model. For this purpose, one group of C57BL/6 mice was used as control; second group of mice were orally supplemented with 200 mg/kg CoQ10 and then infected with PbA and the third group was PbA infected alone. Clinical, biochemical, immunoblot and immunological features of ECM was monitored. We observed that oral administration of CoQ10 for 1 month and after PbA infection was able to improve survival, significantly reduced oedema, TNF-α and MIP-1β gene expression in brain samples in PbA infected mice. The result also shows the ability of CoQ10 to reduce cholesterol and triglycerides lipids, levels of matrix metalloproteinases-9, angiopoietin-2 and angiopoietin-1 in the brain. In addition, CoQ10 was very effective in decreasing NF-κB phosphorylation. Furthermore, CoQ10 supplementation abrogated Malondialdehyde, and 8-OHDG and restored cellular glutathione. These results constitute the first demonstration that oral supplementation of CoQ10 can protect mice against PbA induced oxidative stress and neuro-inflammation usually observed in ECM. Thus, the need to study CoQ10 as a candidate of antioxidant and immunomodulatory molecule in ECM and testing it in clinical studies either alone or in combination with antimalaria regimens to provide insight into a potential translatable therapy.

N2  - Toxoplasmosis is a food-borne infection that is widespread around the world, causing congenital disorders and opportunistic infections. Ingestion of undercooked meat is one of the risk factors for infection with the causative agent, Toxoplasma gondii. Japanese people occasionally eat rare meat as a traditional cuisine style called “Sashimi”. A rapid increase in venison consumption in Japan has occurred mainly due to enhanced population control of wild Japanese deer (Cervus nippon) in recent decades. In particular, Yezo-sika deer (C. n. yesoensis) in Hokkaido (the northernmost and largest prefecture in Japan) is frequently supplied to markets as branded game/bushmeat. To study the possible burden of Toxoplasma gondii among wild Yezo-sika deer, plasma samples of Yezo-sika deer hunted during two seasons, 2010–2012, in Eastern Hokkaido were investigated. A total 80 samples were examined using the Sabin–Feldman dye test, which is highly specific and sensitive for identifying the development and persistence of antibodies after primary Toxoplasma infection, demonstrating that 38 cases (47.5%) were seropositive (cut-off titer <1:16). Antibody prevalence of T. gondii in female deer was higher than in males. Adult deer aged 3 years or over showed higher seroprevalence compared with younger animals. The overall seroprevalence fluctuated significantly according to the season when the deer were hunted. These results indicated widespread infection of T. gondii among Japanese wild Yezo-sika deer, suggesting that both appropriate handling and treatment of bushmeat are required to prevent food-borne toxoplasmosis in Japan.

N2  - The sheep ked, Melophagus ovinus, and the forest fly, Hippobosca equina, are parasitic dipteran insects of veterinary importance. As hematophagous insects, they might be considered as potential vectors of diseases which may be transmissible to humans and animals. The purpose of this study was to present initial primary data about these two species in Algeria. To do so, we conducted a molecular survey to detect the presence of bacterial DNA in flies collected in Algeria. A total of 712 flies including, 683 Melophagus ovinus and 29 Hippobosca equina were collected from two regions in northeastern Algeria. Monitoring the monthly kinetics of M. ovinus infestations showed something resembling annual activity, with a high prevalence in January (21.67%) and May (20.94%). Real-time quantitative PCR assays showed that for 311 tested flies, 126 were positive for the Bartonella spp. rRNA intergenic spacer gene and 77 were positive for Anaplasmataceae. A random selection of positive samples was submitted for sequencing. The DNA of Bartonella chomelii and Bartonella melophagi were amplified in, respectively, five and four H. equina. 25 M. ovinus positive samples were infected by Bartonella melophagi. Amplification and sequencing of the Anaplasma spp. 23S rRNA gene revealed that both species were infected by Wolbachia sp. which had previously been detected in Cimex lectularius bed bugs. Overall, this study expanded knowledge about bacteria present in parasitic flies of domestic animals in Algeria.

N2  - Background: Blastocystis, a common intestinal protozoan of humans and animals, infected more than 1 billion people around the world. This enteric protozoan is frequently reported in both healthy individuals and patients with gastrointestinal (GI)symptoms. Methods: Three hundred and forty-five fecal samples including 151 GI patients and 194 healthy individuals were examined by microscopy, culture and PCR-sequencing techniques to determine Blastocystis frequency and subtype (ST)variation. Results: The occurrence of Blastocystis was detected 56 (16.2%)and 85 (24.6%)by microscopy, culture and PCR methods, respectively. Out of the 85 positive patients, 60 (70.6%)were asymptomatic and 25 (29.4%)were symptomatic. The results of 41 successfully sequenced isolates identified 8 (19.5%), 8 (19.5%), and 25 (61.0%)ST1, ST2, and ST3, respectively. Conclusion: This study has found that Blastocystis was more common in healthy individuals than GI patients. Another finding was that no correlation was found between clinical symptoms and Blastocystis STs.

N2  - When administered alone, preinfection exercise training and benznidazole-based chemotherapy induce cardioprotection in Chagas disease. However, the effect of concomitant exercise and benznidazole treatment is unknown. We investigated whether exercise and specific chemotherapy could interact to modulate parasitemia, inflammation, redox status and heart damage in a murine model of T. cruzi infection. Wistar rats were randomized into an uninfected control group (CNT)and four groups infected with T. cruzi: sedentary untreated (SUN)and treated (STR), and trained untreated (TUN)and treated (TTR). Running training was administered 5 days/week for 4 weeks. Treated animals concomitantly received 100 mg/kg/day benznidazole. Heart inflammation and reactive damage were not detected in CNT animals. Compared to SUN, TUN animals presented increased levels of parasitemia, myocarditis, nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide, protein carbonyl, malondialdehyde, cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-17), catalase, superoxide dismutase and glutathione reductase activity, as well as reduced heart non-protein antioxidant levels (P < 0.05). TTR animals exhibited higher levels of parasitemia, myocarditis, hydrogen peroxide, malondialdehyde, IFN-γ, TNF-α and IL-6 than STR animals (P < 0.05), which showed the lowest levels of all analyzed parameters compared to the other groups (P < 0.05). Our findings indicate that exercise aggravates acute infection. When concomitantly administered with benznidazole, exercise training impaired parasitic control and chemotherapy-induced cardioprotection in T. cruzi-infected rats. Considering that exercise training and T. cruzi infection constitute independent metabolic challenges, the negative effects of concomitant treatment are potentially related to the overlapping oxidative and immunoinflammatory demands of exercise and the infection itself.

N2  - Background: Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are essential in the metabolism of most drugs used today. Single nucleotide polymorphism(s) occurring in CYP genes can adversely affect drug pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety. Individuals carrying the CYP2C8*2 c.805A > T (CYP2C8*2; rs11572103) allele have impaired amodiaquine metabolism, increased risk of amodiaquine-related adverse events, and may promote the selection of drug-resistant parasite strains. This study investigated the distribution of the CYP2C8*2 allele in Brazzaville, Republic of Congo, where artesunate + amodiaquine is used as the second-line treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Methods: A total of 285 febrile children visiting the Marien Ngouabi paediatric hospital were genotyped for CYP2C8*2 using PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The allele frequencies and genotype distribution were determined. Results: The CYP2C8*2 allele was successfully genotyped in 75% (213/285) of the study participants. The CYP2C8*2A allele had a frequency of 63%, whereas the CYP2C8*2T allele had a frequency of 37%. Genotypes CYP2C8*2AA (rapid metabolizer), CYP2C8*2AT (intermediate metabolizer), and CYP2C8*2TT (poor metabolizer) were observed in 44%, 38%, and 18% of the investigated participants, respectively. Conclusions: This study gives the first description of CYP2C8*2 allele distribution in the Republic of Congo and highlights the potential risk of amodiaquine-related adverse events. Information from this study will be beneficial during pharmacovigilance investigations.

N2  - Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is released from host cells during parasite infections and acts as a danger signal in the extracellular space by activating plasma membrane purinergic type 2 receptors-P2 receptors. The activation of these receptors has been described as a crucial step in immune cell activation, inflammation and parasite control. The P2X7 receptor is most involved in the activation of host microbicidal mechanisms, including production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, phagolysosomal fusion, acidification of parasitophorous vacuoles and release of cytokines and chemokines. The P2X7 receptor also modulates adaptive immune responses in various infectious diseases. Here, we discuss key points from the recent literature regarding P2X7 receptor activation during intracellular parasite infections.

N2  - Translocation of animals in fragmented habitats is an important means of dispersal and gene flow, however, the movement of animals has led to the spread of various diseases globally and wildlife are often the reservoirs of these diseases. Currently, Cape mountain zebra are translocated within South Africa as a management method for augmentation of isolated and fragmented populations. The movement of pathogens due to translocations in local regions have gone largely unchecked, particularly where there may still be isolated regions that can be negatively affected. Equine piroplasmosis is a tick-borne disease caused by Theilaria equi and/or Babesia caballi reported to occur in equids (Bhoora et al., 2010; Zweygarth et al., 2002). Here, the presence of T. equi and B. caballi was detected in 137 clinically healthy Cape mountain zebra from three South African reserves, Mountain Zebra National Park (MZNP), De Hoop Nature Reserve (DHNR) and Karoo National Park (KNP) using the multiplex EP real-time PCR (qPCR) assay. We observed 100% prevalence for T. equi and identified only one animal from MZNP with B. caballi. These results affirm that precautions should be taken prior to founding new populations of Cape mountain zebra and that potential farms and properties adjacent to prospective reserves should be screened for the presence of the organisms in order to mitigate risks of infection to domestic animals.

N2  - Fasciolosis is a re-emerging disease of livestock and rarely human, being endemic in Iran. Herein, we aimed to quantitatively assess the human seropositivity and prevalence of animal fasciolosis in our country. English and Persian databases were searched for online literature. In total, 10 human seroprevalence studies and 49 animal investigations were obtained from January 1999 to March 2019. Only animal studies were included in meta-analysis. The highest human seroprevalence was detected in Guilan province (326/452; 50%). The pooled prevalence of the animal infections was calculated as 6.2% (95% CI = 5.8%–6.5%). In detail, the prevalence ranges in three hosts included as 4.2% (95% CI = 3.8%–4.5%) in sheep, 9% (95% CI = 8.0%–9.9%) in cattle and 3.1% (95% CI = 2.4%–3.7%) in goat. The highest prevalence rate was observed in the north, 11.8% (95% CI = 8.4%–15.1%), while the lowest prevalence was detected in the central Iran with 1.8% (95% CI = 1.3%–2.3%). Egger's regression test revealed no significant publication bias (P = 0.307). Also, there was no remarkable correlation between weighted prevalence and sample size (P = 0.249) as well as year of study (P = 0.172). These findings would be necessary for better preventive strategies in case of human and animal Fasciola infections as well as snail intermediate hosts.

N2  - HisAK70 candidates have successfully been tested in cutaneous (CL) and visceral leishmaniosis (VL) mouse models. Here, we analyse different biomarkers in dog trials after a heterologous immunization strategy with a HisAK70 candidate (plasmid DNA plus adoptive transfer of peripheral blood-derived dendritic cells (DCs) pulsed with the same pathoantigen and CpG ODN as an adjuvant) to explore the antileishmanial activity in an ex vivo canine co-culture system in the presence of Leishmania infantum parasites. In the canine model, the heterologous HisAK70 vaccine could decrease the infection index in the DC-T cell co-culture system by up to 54% after 30 days and reach almost 67% after 100 days post-immunization, respectively, compared to those obtained in the control group of dogs. The observed security and potential to ﬁght ex vivo L. infantum infection highlight a HisAK70 heterologous immunization strategy as a promising alternative to evaluate its effectiveness against canine VL.

N2  - Abstract In contrast to mammalian skin, teleost skin has been considered as mucosal surface which serves as the first line of defense against invading pathogens. Moreover, teleost skin contains skin-associated lymphoid tissue (SALT) that elicits gut-like immune responses against parasitic infection. However, little is known so far about the B cells and immunoglobulins (Igs) responds to bacterial infection in the skin mucosal immune system of teleost. We hypothesized that, microbial exposure can elicit a dedicated mucosal Igs response and locally specific immune responses would be generated within its mucosa. To address our hypothesis, we construct an infected model with rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), which was experimentally exposed to Flavobacterium columnare. H & E staining of trout skin shows the morphological changes and qRT-PCR indicates the increased mRNA expression levels of immune-related genes, which were further studied by RNA-Seq analysis, in trout skin after infected with Flavobacterium columnare. Moreover, strikingly increased IgT concentration and strong pathogen-specific IgT responses were detected in the cutaneous mucus, and the accumulation of IgT+ B cells were also noted in the skin epidermis of experimental group. Critically, IgT responses against the pathogen were mainly limited to the skin whereas IgM responses were almost exclusively detected in the serum. Moreover, local IgT+ B cells proliferation and pathogen-specific IgT generation were found in the trout skin, providing new evidence for the local mucosal immune responses in trout skin. Overall, our findings indicate that, following bacteria exposure, IgT and IgT+ B cells play the prevailing role in skin mucosal immunity. To our knowledge, our results provide the first example of locally induced immunoglobulin in the skin of rainbow trout after Flavobacterium columnare infection. keywords: Skin, B cells, Immunoglobulins, Flavobacterium columnare, Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)

N2  - Identification of the structural causes of depression is important for the treatment process, and toxoplasmosis may be related to psychiatric disorders. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) seropositivity and depression in children and adolescents. This case-control study included 37 children and adolescents aged 11–18 years diagnosed with depression who were followed by the Manisa Celal Bayar University Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service and 36 children and adolescents aged 11–18 years with no history of depressive episodes or psychiatric disorder treated by the Pediatric Outpatient Department. The T. gondii serology of these two groups was evaluated and compared. There were no statistically significant age or sex differences between the 37 participants with depression and the 36 healthy controls. Eight patients and two controls were seropositive for T. gondii, a statistically significant difference (p = 0.046). Seropositivity was significantly higher in patients with suicidal ideation (p = 0.005) than in those without suicidal ideation. The seropositivity of seven of the nine participants who attempted suicide was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than that of participants who did not. Thus, T. gondii infection may affect the predisposition for and severity of depression.

N2  - Canine babesiosis is an important tick-borne disease caused by Babesia spp. A total of 130 blood samples were randomly collected from pet dogs in Zhengzhou city, Henan Province, China, and screened for the presence of piroplasms with nested PCR and gene sequencing targeting the 18S rRNA gene. On the basis of blast analysis of the 18S rRNA gene sequences, our results revealed that seven dogs (5.4%) were infected with Babesia canis canis. The sequences were compared with those in GenBank, and alignments showed that all B. canis canis isolates belonged to genotype B. This is the first report of B. canis canis infection in dogs in China.

N2  - Swimmer's itch is an allergic condition that occurs when the motile and infectious stage of avian schistosomes penetrate the skin of an individual. Flatworm parasites that cause swimmer's itch belong to the family Schistosomatidae. They utilize a variety of different species of bird and mammal as definitive hosts, and rely on different species of snail, in which they complete their larval development to culminate in a motile, aquatic, infectious stage called a cercaria. Recently, qPCR-based assays have been developed to monitor for swimmer's itch-causing trematodes in recreational water. This environmental DNA approach has been useful for quantifying the abundance of the free-living cercaria, the causative agent of swimmer's itch. However, the existing qPCR test amplifies from all known schistosome species, making it excellent for assessing a site for swimmer's itch potential, but not useful in determining the specific species contributing to swimmer's itch or the likely hosts (snail and bird)of the swimmer's itch-causing parasites. Thus, species-specific resolution built into a qPCR test would be useful in answering ecological questions about swimmer's itch cause, and efficacy of control efforts. This paper details bird, snail, and cercaria surveys conducted in the summer of 2018, that culminated in the development and deployment of four species-specific qPCR assays, capable of detecting Trichobilharzia stagnicolae, Trichobilharzia szidati, Trichobilharzia physellae, and Anserobilharzia brantae in recreational water. These assays were used to assess the relative abundance of each parasite in water samples collected from lakes in Northern Michigan.

N2  - In cattle, antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii infection are frequently detected, but evidence for the presence of T. gondii tissue cysts in cattle is limited. To study the concordance between the presence of anti-T. gondii IgG and viable tissue cysts of T. gondii in cattle, serum, liver and diaphragm samples of 167 veal calves and 235 adult cattle were collected in Italy, the Netherlands, Romania and the United Kingdom. Serum samples were tested for anti-T. gondii IgG by the modified agglutination test and p30 immunoblot. Samples from liver were analyzed by mouse bioassay and PCR after trypsin digestion. In addition, all diaphragms of cattle that had tested T. gondii-positive (either in bioassay, by PCR on trypsin-digested liver or serologically by MAT) and a selection of diaphragms from cattle that had tested negative were analyzed by magnetic capture quantitative PCR (MC-PCR). Overall, 13 animals were considered positive by a direct detection method: seven out of 151 (4.6%) by MC-PCR and six out of 385 (1.6%) by bioassay, indicating the presence of viable parasites. As cattle that tested positive in the bioassay tested negative by MC-PCR and vice-versa, these results demonstrate a lack of concordance between the presence of viable parasites in liver and the detection of T. gondii DNA in diaphragm. In addition, the probability to detect T. gondii parasites or DNA in seropositive and seronegative cattle was comparable, demonstrating that serological testing by MAT or p30 immunoblot does not provide information about the presence of T. gondii parasites or DNA in cattle and therefore is not a reliable indicator of the risk for consumers.

N2  - Being able to identify the species or genotype of Trichinella is of paramount importance not only for epidemiological studies but to better ascertain the source of outbreaks that still occur worldwide. This has become more critical in recent years given the increase in imported meat products and the relationship that wild animals play in the domestic and sylvatic transmission cycles. In contrast to a time when the genus Trichinella was considered monospecific, research in recent years has revealed that the genus consists of 9 species and at least 3 additional genotypes which have yet to be named. Except for a non-encapsulated clade consisting of Trichinella pseudospiralis, Trichinella zimbabwensis, and Trichinella papuae, all members of this genus are morphologically indistinguishable. Thus, identification has been relegated to using PCR and in special cases, DNA sequencing or restriction enzyme digestion. Rather than using a collection of PCR primers specific for each genotype, a single multiplex PCR previously developed for differentiating the major encapsulated and non-encapsulated genotypes has been adopted by the International Commission on Trichinellosis. Since the assay was first developed, other species have been named. Thus, DNA sequencing has been used to validate closely related genotypes. The ICT recommends genotyping be performed as described herein during all outbreaks and whenever Trichinella has been found in consumable foods.

N2  - Background: In a recent phase III trial (NCT02020889) 53% of mepolizumab-treated versus 19% of placebo-treated patients with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) achieved protocol-defined remission. Objective: We sought to investigate post hoc the clinical benefit of mepolizumab in patients with EGPA using a comprehensive definition of benefit encompassing remission, oral glucocorticoid (OGC) dose reduction, and EGPA relapses. Methods: The randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group trial recruited patients with relapsing/refractory EGPA receiving stable OGCs (prednisolone/prednisone, ≥7.5–50 mg/d) for 4 or more weeks. Patients received 300 mg of subcutaneous mepolizumab or placebo every 4 weeks for 52 weeks. Clinical benefit was defined post hoc as follows: remission at any time (2 definitions used), 50% or greater OGC dose reduction during weeks 48 to 52, or no EGPA relapses. The 2 remission definitions were Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score of 0 plus OGC dose of 4 mg/d or less (remission 1/clinical benefit 1) or 7.5 mg/d or less (remission 2/clinical benefit 2). Clinical benefit was assessed in all patients and among subgroups with a baseline blood eosinophil count of less than 150 cells/μL, baseline OGC dosage of greater than 20 mg/d, or weight of greater than 85 kg. Results: With mepolizumab versus placebo, 78% versus 32% of patients experienced clinical benefit 1, and 87% versus 53% of patients experienced clinical benefit 2 (both P < .001). Significantly more patients experienced clinical benefit 1 with mepolizumab versus placebo in the blood eosinophil count less than 150 cells/μL subgroup (72% vs 43%, P = .033) and weight greater than 85 kg subgroup (68% vs 23%, P = .005); in the OGC greater than 20 mg/d subgroup, results were not significant but favored mepolizumab (60% vs 36%, P = .395). Conclusion: When a comprehensive definition of clinical benefit was applied to data from a randomized controlled trial, 78% to 87% of patients with EGPA experienced benefit with mepolizumab.

N2  - In Bulgaria, only Dobrava orthohantavirus has been detected in patients and in rodents. In order to elucidate possible Puumala orthohantavirus (PUUV) circulation, 131 bank voles (Myodes glareolus) were captured. PUUV RNA was detected in 14 (10.7%). Partial L segment sequences were recovered from six M. glareolus. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all PUUV sequences from this study clustered together among the Alpe-Adrian lineage. It is the first genetic evidence of the virus circulation in a Balkan country outside north-western Balkans. The findings in this study extended the known edge of virus distribution towards Southeastern Europe.

N2  - Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients may infrequently develop parasitic infections at the time of the procedure via contamination from allograft tissue or blood products, and in the post-transplantation period through the traditional route of infection or as a reactivation caused by immunosuppression related to the transplant. To reduce risk, efforts should be directed at performing a comprehensive history, maintaining a high index of suspicion, and adhering to preventive measures. Additional strategies for the prevention, screening and careful follow-up, identification, and pre-emptive treatment of parasitic infections are required to reduce morbidity and mortality in HSCT patients.

N2  - Background: Climate change may lead to emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases and pose public health challenges to human health and the already overloaded healthcare system. It is therefore important to review current knowledge and identify further directions in China, the largest developing country in the world. Methods: A comprehensive literature review was conducted to examine the relationship between climate variability and infectious disease transmission in China in the new millennium. Literature was identified using the following MeSH terms and keywords: climatic variables [temperature, precipitation, rainfall, humidity, etc.] and infectious disease [viral, bacterial and parasitic diseases]. Results: Fifty-eight articles published from January 1, 2000 to May 30, 2018 were included in the final analysis, including bacterial diarrhea, dengue, malaria, Japanese encephalitis, HFRS, HFMD, Schistosomiasis. Each 1 °C rise may lead to 3.6%–14.8% increase in the incidence of bacillary dysentery disease in south China. A 1 °C rise was corresponded to an increase of 1.8%–5.9% in the weekly notified HFMD cases in west China. Each 1 °C rise of temperature, 1 rise in relative humidity and one hour rise in sunshine led to an increase of 0.90%, 3.99% and 0.68% in the monthly malaria cases, respectively. Climate change with the increased temperature and irregular patterns of rainfall may affect the pathogen reproduction rate, their spread and geographical distribution, change human behavior and influence the ecology of vectors, and increase the rate of disease transmission in different regions of China. Conclusion: Exploring relevant adaptation strategies and the health burden of climate change will assist public health authorities to develop an early warning system and protect China's population health, especially in the new 1.5 °C scenario of the newly released IPCC special report.

N2  - Tortoises belonging to the Testudinidae family are infected by Testudinid herpesviruses. Testudinid herpesvirus 3 (TeHV-3) is considered the most pathogenic and affects several tortoise species, particularly those from the Testudo genus. As most species of this genus are endangered contribute to ecological concerns over this virus. Here, we aimed to explore the rational development of an antiviral treatment against TeHV-3 using Hermann's tortoise (Testudo hermanni) as a host model. Ten antiviral compounds were tested in cell culture for their toxicity and their activity against TeHV-3. Eight compounds exhibited different levels of activity against TeHV-3 with either no or only minor cytotoxic effects on cells. Next, eprociclovir (EPV, ciprovir) was selected for further investigations in vivo. Its pharmacokinetic properties were investigated after a single sub-cutaneous administration at 5 or 10 mg/kg. Plasma concentrations remained above half maximal effective concentration (EC50) for 2.2 and 4.4 h after administration at 5 and 10 mg/kg, respectively. Finally, EPV toxicity was investigated after administration at the dose of 10 mg/kg, BID for seven consecutive days. As early as one day after initiation of the treatment up to its end, EPV plasma concentration remained under the EC50. Apathy and anorexia developed after 7 days. Biochemical and anatomopathological examinations revealed nephrotoxic effects of EPV. Altogether, these data suggest that EPV is not a suitable molecule for the treatment of TeHV-3. Further studies are required to determine whether the other molecules identified here for their anti-TeHV-3 activity represent potential candidates for the development of efficacious treatments.

N2  - Background: Meningococcal disease continues to be a global public health concern due to its epidemic potential, severity, and sequelae. The global epidemiological data on circulating meningococcal serogroups have never been reviewed concurrently with the laboratory capacity for meningococcal surveillance at the national level. We, therefore, aimed to conduct a country-level review of meningococcal surveillance, serogroup distribution, and vaccine use. Methods: We conducted a systematic literature review across six databases to identify studies (published January 1, 2010 to October 16, 2017) and grey literature reporting meningococcal serogroup data for the years 2010-2016. We performed independent random effects meta-analyses for serogroups A, B, C, W, X, Y, and other. We developed and circulated a questionnaire-based survey to surveillance focal points in countries (N = 95) with known regional bacterial meningitis surveillance programs to assess their surveillance capacity and summarized using descriptive methods. Results: We included 173 studies from 59 countries in the final analysis. The distribution of meningococcal serogroups differed markedly between countries and regions. Meningococcal serogroups C and W accounted for substantial proportions of meningococcal disease in most of Africa and Latin America. Serogroup B was the predominant cause of meningococcal disease in many locations in Europe, the Americas, and the Western Pacific. Serogroup Y also caused many cases of meningococcal disease in these regions, particularly in Nordic countries. Survey responses were received from 51 countries. All countries reported the ability to confirm the pathogen in-country, while approximately 30% either relied on reference laboratories for serogrouping (N = 10) or did not serogroup specimens (N = 5). Approximately half of countries did not utilize active laboratory-based surveillance system (N = 22). Nationwide use of a meningococcal vaccine varied, but most countries (N = 36) utilized a meningococcal vaccine at least for certain high-risk population groups, in private care, or during outbreaks. Conclusions: Due to the large geographical variations in circulating meningococcal serogroups, each country should continue to be monitored for changes in major disease-causing serogroups in order to inform vaccine and control policies. Similarly, laboratory capacity should be appropriately scaled up to more accurately understand local epidemiology and disease burden, as well as the impact of vaccination programs.

N2  - Infectious complications represent one of the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients. Prophylactic and preemptive treatment strategies against bacterial, fungal, viral, and parasitic pathogens are routinely implemented during high-risk post-HCT periods at most transplant centers. The basic concepts and review of current guidelines of antibiotic prophylaxis and empirical/preemptive antibiotic treatment in allogeneic HCT recipients are reviewed in this article.

N2  - Ticks cause anemia, toxicosis, growth delay, and transmit infectious diseases in animals and humans. The current study aimed to evaluate the immunoprophylactic properties of two vaccine candidates to develop vaccine against tick infestations. These two vaccine candidates were specific fraction from the adults of the soft tick Ornithodoros savignyi and cross-reactive fraction from the adults of the hard tick Hyalomma dromedarii. Both specific and cross-reactive fractions were isolated by Cyanogen Bromide-activated Sepharose-4B affinity column chromatography. Both candidates proved their cross-reactivity by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot. Characterization of the two vaccines by SDS-PAGE showed that the O. savignyi specific fraction consists of four bands; 97, 85, 66 and 11.5 kDa compared with nine bands associated with its crude antigen (196–11.5 kDa). The H. dromedarii cross-reactive vaccine candidate consists of three bands; 97, 66 and 45 kDa compared to eight bands of its crude antigen (196–21 kDa). Two common bands of 97 and 66 kDa between two candidates showed immunogenic cross-reactivity with the developed antisera of both infestations by Western blot. Immunization of rabbits intramuscularly with two doses of the fractions separately (40 µg/kg) led to immunological and parasitological changes. Immunologically; the level of immunoglobulins in vaccinated rabbits increased significantly compared with control infested non-vaccinated rabbits. These immunoglobulins are probably responsible for the protective effect of both candidates. Parasitologically, immunized rabbits showed protection against infestation by adult ticks as proved by significant feeding rejection percentage and significant reduction in egg and engorgement weights of H. dromedarii. While insignificant protection was observed against O. savignyi ticks infestation in feeding rejection and reduction in engorgement weight. In conclusion, this study suggests promising immunoprophylactic potentials of the purified fractions against tick infestations in rabbits through induction of IgG responses. The protective effect of both vaccine candidates deserves further evaluation in other hosts and against other tick infestations.

N2  - Background: Blepharitis is a common finding in many dogs with various skin diseases. Objectives: To establish a definition for canine blepharitis versus periocular dermatitis (POD), to evaluate the clinical findings and underlying skin diseases of blepharitis, and to document the effects of blepharitis on tear production in dogs. Animals: One hundred and two privately owned dogs with clinical signs of blepharitis and a definitive diagnosis of skin disease. Methods and materials: Prospective evaluation of clinical signs and underlying diseases in dogs with blepharitis alone compared to dogs with blepharitis and POD. Results: Brachycephalic dogs were significantly more likely to present with blepharitis than other breeds. Twenty five dogs had blepharitis alone [three dogs (2.9%) without and 22 dogs (21.5%) with cutaneous lesion beyond the periocular skin]. Seventy one of 102 (69%) presented with POD in addition to blepharitis. In six cases a differentiation between blepharitis and POD was not possible. Typical lesions included alopecia/hypotrichosis (97%), erythema (93%), eyelid oedema (50%) and crusts (39.2%). Allergic skin disease (52%) was the most common underlying cause of blepharitis, followed by infectious/parasitic diseases (21.5%), autoimmune disorders (17.7%) and neoplasia (4.9%). Four dogs could not be allocated to any of these disease groups. A diagnosis of parasitism was always accompanied by POD. Reduced tear production was detected in ten of the 53 dogs tested (18.8%). Conclusion: Blepharitis occurring in the absence of other skin lesions is rare. The most common underlying cause of blepharitis is allergic dermatitis. Measurement of tear production should be recommended in all cases of blepharitis.

N2  - This paper provides a view of the major facts and figures related to infectious diseases with a focus on food-borne and water-borne diseases and their link with environmental factors and climate change. The global burden of food-borne diseases for 31 selected hazards was estimated by the World Health Organization at 33 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in 2010 with 40% of this burden concentrated among children under 5 years of age. The highest burden per population of food-borne diseases is found in Africa, followed by Southeast Asia and the Eastern Mediterranean sub-regions. Unsafe water used for the cleaning and processing of food is a key risk factors contributing to food-borne diseases. The role of quality and quantity of water to the general burden of infectious diseases deserves attention, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, as its effects go beyond the food chain. Water-related infectious diseases are a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, and climate change effects will exacerbate the challenges for the public health sector for both food-borne and water-borne diseases. Selected case studies from Africa and Asia show that (i) climate change extreme events, such as floods, may exacerbate the risks for infectious diseases spreading through water systems, and (ii) improvements related to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene could result in a significant reduction of intestinal parasitic infections among school-aged children. There is a need to better anticipate the impacts of climate change on infectious diseases and fostering multi-stakeholder engagement and multi-sectoral collaborations for integrated interventions at schools, community and household levels. The paper calls for giving priority to improving the environmental conditions affecting food-borne and water-borne infectious diseases under climate change.

N2  - Febrile illness is a major burden in African children, and non-malarial causes of fever are uncertain. In this retrospective exploratory study, we used metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) to evaluate serum, nasopharyngeal, and stool specimens from 94 children (aged 2–54 months) with febrile illness admitted to Tororo District Hospital, Uganda. The most common microbes identified were Plasmodium falciparum (51.1% of samples) and parvovirus B19 (4.4%) from serum; human rhinoviruses A and C (40%), respiratory syncytial virus (10%), and human herpesvirus 5 (10%) from nasopharyngeal swabs; and rotavirus A (50% of those with diarrhea) from stool. We also report the near complete genome of a highly divergent orthobunyavirus, tentatively named Nyangole virus, identified from the serum of a child diagnosed with malaria and pneumonia, a Bwamba orthobunyavirus in the nasopharynx of a child with rash and sepsis, and the genomes of two novel human rhinovirus C species. In this retrospective exploratory study, mNGS identified multiple potential pathogens, including 3 new viral species, associated with fever in Ugandan children.

N2  - Malaria is induced by infection with Plasmodium parasites, which are genetically diverse, and the immune response to Plasmodium infection has both allele-specific and cross-reactive components. To determine the role of the cross-reactive immune response in the protection and disease manifestation in heterologous Plasmodium infection, we used infection models of P. chabaudi chabaudi (Pcc) and P. berghei ANKA (PbA). CD4+ T cells primed with Pcc infection exhibited strong cross-reactivity to PbA antigens. We infected C57BL/6 mice with Pcc and subsequently treated them with an anti-Plasmodium drug. The Pcc-primed mice exhibited reduced parasitemia and showed no signs of experimental cerebral malaria after infection with PbA. CD4+ T cells from the Pcc-primed mice produced high levels of IFN-γ and IL-10 in response to PbA early after PbA infection. The blockade of IL-10 signaling with anti-IL-10 receptor antibody increased the proportion of activated CD4+ and γδ T cells and the IFN-γ production by CD4+ T cells in response to PbA antigens, while markedly reducing the levels of parasitemia. In contrast, IL-10 blockade did not have a significant effect on parasitemia levels in unprimed mice after PbA infection. These data suggest a potent regulatory role of IL-10 in the cross-reactive memory response to the infection with heterologous Plasmodium parasites leading to the inhibition of the protective immunity and pathogenesis.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The fungus Paracoccidioides lutzii was recently included as a new causative species of paracoccidioidomycosis (PCM) and most cases have been reported from Brazil. According to available epidemiological information, P. lutzii is concentrated in the Middle-West region in Brazil, mainly in the state of Mato Grosso. However, clinical and laboratorial data available on patients infected with P. lutzii remain extremely limited. METHODOLOGY/MAIN FINDINGS: This work describes the clinical manifestations of 34 patients suffering from PCM caused by P. lutzii, treated along 5 years (2011-2017) at a reference service center for systemic mycoses in Mato Grosso, Brazil. Adult rural workers (men), aged between 28 and 67 predominated. All patients had the chronic form of the disease, and the oral mucosa (n = 19; 55.9%), lymph nodes (n = 23; 67.7%), skin (n = 16; 47.1%) and lung (n = 28; 82.4%) were the most affected sites. Alcohol intake (n = 19; 55.9%) and smoking (n = 29; 85.3%) were frequent habits among the patients. No patient suffered from any other life-threatening disease, such as tuberculosis, cancer or other inflammatory or infectious parasitic diseases. The positivity in culture examination (97.1%) was higher than that found for the direct mycological examination (88.2%). Particularly, one patient presented fungemia at diagnosis, which lead to his death. The time elapsed between the initial symptoms and the initiation of treatment of PCM caused by P. lutzii was 19.7 (31.5) months, with most patients diagnosed 7 months after the symptoms' onset. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Compared with the classical clinical-epidemiological profile of PCM caused by P. brasiliensis, the results of this descriptive study did not show significant clinical or epidemiological differences that could be attributed to the species P. lutzii. Future studies may confirm or refute the existence of clinical differences between the two fungal species.

N2  - Acanthamoeba as free-living parasites are scattered ubiquitously, throughout the world. This study was aimed to evaluate the presence of Acanthamoeba spp. genotypes in the recreational water sources in Gorgan County, the capital of Golestan Province using both morphological and molecular approaches. Thirty water samples were collected from different recreational waters in Gorgan, the capital of Golestan Province, northern Iran during 2015–2016. Samples were filtered and followed by culture in non-nutrient agar. Acanthamoeba were identified both by morphological and molecular analysis. The pathogenical potential of positive cloned samples were also determined using tolerance test. Twenty-six percent of recreational water were identified as Acanthamoeba spp. based on the morphological analysis and from these positive samples, five samples were successfully sequenced after molecular studies. Phylogenetic analysis showed the clustering of four samples in T4 genotype group and only one sample as T15 genotype. Thermotolerance test revealed that all cloned samples were highly positive. Since the attractiveness of recreational places for people is increasing, the potential risk of this water should be monitored routinely in each region. More studies are needed to better evaluate the risk of this ubiquitous parasite for the human.

N2  - Purpose/Background: Movement around our globe is becoming easier and more commonplace. In 2016, approximately 1.5 million foreign-born individuals immigrated to the United States, and in 2017, there were nearly 80 million international visitor arrivals to the United States. With the movement of such massive numbers of people, we can expect to encounter medical diagnoses here in the United States previously thought of as only occurring elsewhere. Methods/Interventions: This is a 67 year old male from the Philippines. He had a history of schistosomiasis treated originally more than 20 years ago. 5 years earlier on routine screening colonoscopy he was told that a colon cancer was found. A few days later however the biopsies came back as schistosomiasis eggs. He was treated again at that time. He presente again for routine screening colonoscopy and a mid sigmoid adenocarcinoma arising in a tubular adenoma was found. He had a negative metastatic workup and was scheduled for an elective robotic sigmoid colectomy. Upon initial exploration of the abdomen, multiple nodular implants were found within the pericolic fat and serosa of the sigmoid colon adjacent to the the area of the tattooed lesion. Further epxloration showed that these whitish implants were additionally seen scattered along the mesentery to the sigmoid colon and throughout the rest of the abdomen concerning for carcinomatosis (image 1). The implants were biopsied and sent for frozen section. The frozen section returned fibrous tissue with parasitic eggs consistent with schistosomiasis and no tumor. The surgery was completed, and the patient underwent a successful resection of the sigmoid colon cancer. Postoperatively, the schistosomiasis was treated with praziquantel after consultation with an infectious disease specialist. Results/Outcome(s): The patient was discharged on POD #3 uneventfully. Final Pathology: Invasive moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma in association with tubular adenoma with lymphatic invasion, one of twenty-seven lymph nodes is positive for tumor, AJCC stage (8th ed): pT2 N1a. Parasitic eggs (schistosoma) extensively involve colonic wall and replace most lymph nodes. Conclusions/Discussion: This is a patient with colon cancer in whom peritoneal carcintomatosis was immediately suspected upon identification of peritoneal implants, however, the implants were found to be parasitic which was an unexpected diagnosis. Schistosomiasis is a common disease worldwide, affecting over 200 million people, however, it is historically rarely encountered or reported in the United States. There have been a small number of case series published in endemic areas (China, Japan) implicating schistosomiasis in the development of colon cancer. To our knowledge this is the first case report of a colorectal cancer associated with schistosomiasis in the United States. In today's “global world”, diagnoses that were previously rarely encountered in the United States such a parasitic infections or miliary tuberculosis are becoming more commonplace and may mimic more frequently encountered diagnoses such as carinomatosis. It is important for the surgeon to bear this in mind when an unanticipated or unexplained finding is made.

N2  - The lethal disease alveolar echinococcosis (AE) is caused by the metacestode stage of the fox tapeworm Echinococcus multilocularis. Current chemotherapeutical treatment of AE relies on albendazole and mebendazole, with the caveat that these compounds are not parasiticidal. Drugs have to be taken for a prolonged period of time, often life-long, which can cause adverse effects and reduces the patients’ quality of life. In some individuals, benzimidazoles are inactive or cause toxicity, leading to treatment discontinuation. Alternatives to benzimidazoles are urgently needed. Over the recent years, in vivo and in vitro models for low-to-medium throughput drug discovery against AE have been set in place. In vitro drug tests include the phosphoglucose-isomerase (PGI) assay to measure physical damage induced to metacestodes, and viability assays to assess parasiticidal activity against metacestodes and stem cells. In vitro models are also employed for studies on mechanisms of action. In vivo models are thus far based on rodents, mainly mice, and benefits could be gained in future by comparative approaches in naturally infected dogs or captive monkeys. For the identification of novel drugs against AE, a rare disease with a low expected market return, drug-repurposing is the most promising strategy. A variety of chemically synthesized compounds as well as natural products have been analyzed with respect to in vitro and/or in vivo activities against AE. We here review and discuss the most active of these compounds including anti-infective compounds (benzimidazoles, nitazoxanide, amphotericin B, itraconazole, clarithromycin, DB1127, and buparvaquone), the anti-infective anti-malarials (artemisinin, ozonids, mefloquine, and MMV665807) and anti-cancer drugs (isoflavones, 2-methoxyestradiol, methotrexate, navelbine, vincristine, kinase inhibitors, metallo-organic ruthenium complexes, bortezomib, and taxanes). Taking into account the efficacy as well as the potential availability for patients, the most promising candidates are new formulations of benzimidazoles and mefloquine. Future drug-repurposing approaches should also target the energy metabolism of E. multilocularis, in particular the understudied malate dismutation pathway, as this offers an essential target in the parasite, which is not present in mammals.

N2  - Purpose: To understand the frequency of urinary schistosomiasis, in migrants in clinical follow-up at the infectious disease outpatient clinic of ARNAS Civico Hospital in Palermo Italy, to raise awareness on this neglected tropical disease. Methods: A retrospective analysis of migrant patients in clinical care in our centre during the triennium 2015–2017. Results: 2639 migrants have been in clinical care during the triennium 2015–2017, 72% are male and 28% are female. 214 patients were tested for the presence of Schistosoma eggs in urine, these patients are all male. All the patients tested, reported macroscopic haematuria and the 54% had an increase in the peripheral blood eosinophil count. Ninety subjects had a positive microscopic examination for Schistosoma haematobium eggs. Patients were treated with a standard dose of praziquantel (40 mg/kg), and tested for Schistosoma 1 month after the end of therapy. All the subjects fully recovered. Conclusions: Considering the migration phenomenon, the observation of these tropical diseases in European hospitals is becoming more and more common and an increasing number of health care professionals will be dealing with migrants. Searching for haematuria and eosinophilia and then testing for Schistosoma in this specific population will increase the number of diagnosis and correct treatment of urinary schistosomiasis, improving the patients’ quality of life and preventing severe complications of the disease.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Cystic echinococcosis (CE) is a zoonosis endemic in Spain caused by the larval stage of the cestode Echinococcus granulosus and is one of the 18 neglected tropical diseases recognized by the WHO. The aim of this study was to describe the epidemiological and clinical data of CE in a surgical referral hospital. METHODS: A retrospective descriptive study of all adults' patients diagnosed with CE and followed at Vall d'Hebron University Hospital in Barcelona, Spain, between 2000 and 2015. RESULTS: We found 151 cases, 78 (51.7%) women, and median age at diagnosis was 68 (range, 15-92) years. Diagnosis was a radiological finding in 97 (64.2%) and the most frequent location was the liver [135 (89.4%) patients]. Nearly 80% of the cysts were calcified and serology was positive in 48 (51.6%). The WHO-IWGE classification was only available in 70 of the 104 (67.3%) cases of liver cysts that had an ultrasound. First therapeutic plan was "watch and wait" followed by surgery. International recommendations were not always followed, particularly in CE4 and CE5 stages, and 20% needed a change of treatment because of progression or recurrence. Patients treated surgically were younger, more symptomatic, and had larger and less calcified cysts in multiple sites. Serology was not useful for CE diagnosis and neither serology nor calcification of the cyst helped to predict viability. CONCLUSIONS: The formation of multidisciplinary teams in reference hospitals could help to improve CE diagnosis, its management, and follow-up, since international recommendations are not usually followed.

N2  - Objectives: Congenital toxoplasmosis (CT) affects one to ten fetuses per 10 000 live newborns in western countries. Without knowing pre-conception serostatus, it is hard to date the infection when anti-Toxoplasma IgG and IgM antibodies are positive at first screening. Although a high IgG avidity index (AI) in the first trimester excludes CT, the same cannot be said of intermediate and low AI. The aim of this study was to estimate the risk of CT when intermediate or low AI is detected in the first trimester of pregnancy. Methods: Our observational retrospective study enrolled women with positive anti-Toxoplasma IgG and IgM, and low/intermediate AI in the first trimester of gestation seen at two reference centres in northern Italy between 2006 and 2015. All women received spiramycin. When requested by women, a sample of fluid obtained through amniocentesis was tested with a commercial real-time PCR. CT was defined by positive PCR result confirmed on aborted materials or by newborn follow up. Results: Overall, 778 first-trimester pregnant women were included; AI was low in 532/778 (68%) and intermediate in 246/778 (32%). Amniocenteses were performed in 528/778 (67.9%), with no fetal loss. In all, 19/778 (2.4%) miscarriages and 15/778 (1.9%) pregnancy terminations were recorded; 9/778 (1.6%) were lost to follow up. In two women, PCR on amniotic fluid was positive, but CT was confirmed in only 1/747 cases (0.13%, 95% CI 0.02%–0.75%). Conclusion: In our study, the risk of CT was much lower than anticipated. These data must be considered when counselling these women.

N2  - Background: [18F]-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT) imaging provides important information about the size and metabolic activity of lesions caused by Echinococcus multilocularis and is therefore recommended for the initial assessment and follow-up of human alveolar echinococcosis (AE). The introduction of positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) into clinical practice in affluent health care systems provides an alternative dual imaging modality, which has not yet been evaluated for AE. Objective: Here, we describe the initial clinical experience with comparative PET/CT and PET/MR imaging in four human AE patients at an Austrian reference centre. Results: PET/MR imaging showed comparable diagnostic capacity for liver lesions attributable to E. multilocularis infection, with a discrepancy only in the assessment of calcifications in one patient. Effective doses of radiation were 30.4–31 mSV for PET/CT, which were reduced in PET/MRI to the exposure of 18F-FDG only (4.9–5.5 mSv). Conclusions: PET/MRI provides comparable diagnostic information for AE management. The reduction in radiation exposure compared to PET/CT may be of particular importance for children and young patients not amenable for curative surgery requiring repeated long-term follow-up with dual imaging modalities. Further studies are warranted to prospectively evaluate the potential of PET/MRI in the management of AE.

N2  - Severe malaria is an uncommon diagnosis in the United States. However, awareness of signs, symptoms, and treatment options is imperative in order to promptly initiate optimal therapy. False positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)results are rare in the setting of acute malaria infection and with the introduction of newer fourth-generation immunoassays. The Centers for Disease Control algorithms assist in confirming true HIV infection (Branson et al. 2014).

N2  - The objective of this study was to investigate the presence of Toxocara eggs on the hair of stray cats. The total number of stray cats trapped and included in the trial was 167 that were collected weekly from different residential areas of Mashhad, in northeastern Iran, from November 2016 to December 2017. Among the 167 cats, 18 (10.8%) of them were positive to T. cati eggs in their hair. In the positive cats, 7 (39%) were adult, 1 (6%) was juvenile and 10 (55%) were kittens. Overall, the mean number of eggs from positive cats was 3.9 ± 1.7 eggs per gram (epg) of hair per cat with an average of 3.1 ± 1.4 in adults, 4.9 in juveniles and 4.3 ± 1.6 in kittens. In total, 39.9% of the eggs recovered were non-viable 35.5% were viable, 22.2% were embryonating and 2.3% were embryonated which embryonated eggs were found only in juveniles. Based on our data, kittens were responsible for 61.7% of the total number of eggs. The age of the cat was found to be an important risk factor associated with parasitic infection. This study showed that cat hair contaminated by T. cati eggs in different developmental stages represents of potential source for human toxocariasis.

N2  - Crusted scabies is a rare disease variant associated with T-cell dysregulation. Transplant patients are at risk of developing crusted scabies as a consequence of their immunosuppressive regimens. We report a case of crusted scabies presenting with recurrent septicemia in a 65-year-old renal transplant recipient, treated with daily ivermectin for 7 days after initial failure of weekly ivermectin dosing. A literature review of crusted scabies in transplant recipients consisting of 19 cases reports was summarized. Pruritus was common, and initial misdiagnosis was frequent. Most were treated with topical therapy, with one-third receiving ivermectin. Three of seven cases presenting with a concomitant infection died. Crusted scabies is commonly misdiagnosed in transplant recipients owing to its rarity, varied appearance, and different skin distributions. It should be considered in the differential diagnosis of transplant recipients presenting with rash and pruritus, given its association with secondary infection and subsequent mortality.

N2  - Lutzomyia longipalpis (Diptera: Psychodidae) is the primary vector of Leishmania infantum (Kinetoplastida: Trypanosomatidae) in the Americas. Studies have been carried out to identify new alternatives for monitoring and controlling this sandfly species, particularly with the use of chemical baits. The attractiveness of odours emitted by foxes and alcohols found in some plants has already been demonstrated in laboratory tests with Lu. longipalpis. However, no studies have evaluated the responses of these insects to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by dogs. The present study was carried out to investigate the effects on Lu. longipalpis of individual and blends of VOCs identified in hair from dogs infected with L. infantum. Effects in male and female Lu. longipalpis were assessed using wind tunnel methodology. Individual compounds including octanal, nonanal, decanal and heptadecane showed capacity for activating and/or attracting male Lu. longipalpis. Only decanal and nonanal showed effects on females. The combination of octanal, decanal and heptadecane increased activation and attraction behaviour in male sandflies, as did the blend of octanal and decanal. These findings indicate that VOCs emitted by dogs may be an interesting source of new attractants of sandflies.

N2  - Trichomonas vaginalis is the most common curable sexually transmitted infection (STI) worldwide. Although predominately asymptomatic, the disease spectrum of trichomoniasis in women is characterized primarily by signs and symptoms of vaginitis, including purulent discharge and localized vulvar pruritus and erythema. Several FDA-cleared nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are available for the diagnosis of T. vaginalis infections, but laboratory developed tests (LDTs) are widely utilized and cost-effective solutions in both the research and clinical diagnostic settings. LDT diagnosis of T. vaginalis is particularly appealing since it can be performed using remnant specimens collected for other STI testing. Using a LDT implemented as part of this study, T. vaginalis was detected in 7% of participating Louisiana women (14/199). The mean T. vaginalis organism burden was 1.0x106 ± 4.5x105 organisms per mL of ThinPrep PreservCyt. Using DNA eluates obtained after HPV testing on the cobas 4800 system, the T. vaginalis LDT was characterized by excellent intra- and interassay reproducibility (coefficient of variation values all <3.5%). Compared with two commercially available NAATs from TIB MOLBIOL, the sensitivity and specificity of the LDT was 92.9 and 99.5%, respectively. Collectively, this study details the diagnostic and quantitative utility of a LDT for T. vaginalis. When applied in the clinical research setting, we confirmed the high prevalence of T. vaginalis, but also observed extraordinarily high organism burdens in the cervix. These findings highlight the unique host-pathogen relationship of T. vaginalis with lower reproductive tract tissues, and substantiate the need for continued investigation of this highly prevalent STI.

N2  - The generation of an efficacious vaccine that elicits protective CD4+ T cell-mediated immunity has been elusive. The lack of a vaccine against the Leishmania parasite is particularly perplexing as infected individuals acquire life-long immunity to reinfection. Experimental observations suggest that the relationship between immunological memory and protection against Leishmania is not straightforward and that a new paradigm is required to inform vaccine design. These observations include: (i) induction of Th1 memory is a component of protective immunity, but is not sufficient; (ii) memory T cells may be protective only if they generate circulating effector cells prior to, not after, challenge; and (iii) the low-dose/high-inflammation conditions of physiological vector transmission compromises vaccine efficacy. Understanding the implications of these observations is likely key to efficacious vaccination.

N2  - Background: The antigen B protein of Echinococcus granulosus (EgAgB)is an important protein present in hydatid cyst fluid (HCF)that plays roles in immunogenicity and in the preparation of antibodies against cystic echinococcosis (CE). Aim: This study aimed to use molecular and bioinformatics analysis in two important EgAgB/1 and EgAgB/4 subunit proteins in G1 and G6 genotypes of E. granulosus in Iran. Methods: Sequences of EgAgB/1 and EgAgB/4 genes related to confirmed G1 and G6 genotypes of E. granulosus were achieved by using specific primers. Alignment and phylogenetic analysis were done on predicted protein sequences by BioEdit and MEGA 7 software, respectively. The Swiss model software (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/)was used to create the three-dimensional structure of the desired amino acid sequence to find discontinuous epitopes. To predict the linear and discontinuous epitopes, online epitope software prediction including IEDB (http://www.iedb.org/)and SYFPEITHI (www.syfpeithi.de/)were used. Results: Alignment analysis of predicted protein showed no differences in EgAgB/1 amino acid sequences in G1 and G6 genotypes. Hence, EgAgB/4 amino acids in G6 genotype sequences were different in 4 positions compared to G1 genotypes. The results showed that the tertiary structures of EgAgB/1 and EgAgB/4 proteins in two G1 and G6 genotypes were similar. Finally, according to the results obtained from linear and discontinuous epitopes, the specified residues could be considered as a potential candidate for E. granulosus genotypes G1 and G6 vaccines. Conclusion: The results obtained from linear and discontinuous epitopes showed the specified residues could be considered as a potential vaccines candidate against E. granulosus genotypes G1 and G6. The findings of this study provide the bases for future investigations on these two important proteins in the parasite.

N2  - There is a need for new, effective, and less expensive and toxic treatment for Leishmaniasis. It seems that the use of a suitable adjuvant and a delivery system is effective in inducing immune reactions for protection. Liposomes can be applied as immunoadjuvants to trigger immune reactions to different antigens. The adjuvant effects of imiquimod using DSPC liposomes containing SLA (soluble Leishmania antigens) were studied on the type and intensity of the produced immune reaction to the challenge of Leishmania major in BALB/c mice. Liposomes were produced by the lipid film procedure. BALB/C mice were immunized subcutaneously, three times at 2-week intervals and with various formulations. Lesion development and the parasite burden in the spleens and feet after the challenge with Leishmania major, Th1 cytokine (IFN-γ), and the IgG isotype titration were assessed to evaluate the induced immune reaction and the protection level. The group of mice immunized with Liposome DSPC +Imiquimod +SLA revealed less severe footpad swelling, being significantly different (P <.05) from other groups. A higher level of IgG2a and IFN-γ secretion was observed in the mice immunized with Liposome DSPC +Imiquimod +SLA than the control group. These observations imply that the DSPC liposome containing imiquimod induces the Th1 immune response that is protective against the challenge of Leishmania major.

N2  - Recent evidence suggests that 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (VD3), the active form of vitamin D, inhibits microbial proliferation. Previously, we used in vivo murine models to investigate the antimalarial activity of VD3 and confirmed potent antimalarial activity in the acute phase. This study aimed to clarify the mechanisms underlying the antimalarial activity of VD3 in vivo, particularly extensive inhibition of parasitemia in the acute phase, focusing on nitric oxide (NO), a potent antimalarial molecule. VD3 is a good NO inducer. When most Plasmodium chabaudi AS (PcAS)-infected mice treated with VD3 survived, NO was present in blood samples obtained from VD3-treated mice at a significantly higher rate at 2 and/or 3 days post-infection than that in vehicle-treated control mice. To verify the involvement of NO in the antimalarial activity of VD3, we used aminoguanidine (AG), an inducible NO synthase (iNOS)inhibitor, to abrogate the antimalarial activity of VD3. However, despite AG-induced reductions in NO levels, parasitemia remained inhibited during the acute phase, even in the presence of AG, and the antiplasmodial faculty of VD3 was not ablated. VD3-mediated antimalarial activity irrelevant of NO compelled us to consider another candidate. In a pilot experiment, we used cathelicidin (CAMP), an antimicrobial peptide, since it is known that VD3 induces CAMP synthesis. Serum CAMP levels increased on days 4 or 5 post-infection with or without VD3 administration, but experiments using exogenous CAMP did not display curative effects in PcAS-infected mice. The present study using VD3 to target the malarial parasite thus suggests a potential novel approach to treat malarial infections.

N2  - Livestock-wildlife interactions promote the transmission of a wide range of infectious diseases that constraint livestock production. We used a participatory appraisal approach to find out and rank infectious diseases of concern to pastoralists in a zone of intense wildlife-livestock interaction and another zone with limited interactions. Four villages were selected purposively in areas with intensive cattle-wildlife interactions (zone 1), and another two in areas with low to moderate cattle-wildlife interactions (zone 2). Data were collected in focus group discussions (FGDs) using participatory epidemiological methods (PE); each group had 8-13 participants. Results of impact matrix scoring from all sites indicated that malignant catarrhal fever (MCF), anthrax, foot and mouth disease (FMD), contagious bovine pleuropneumonia (CBPP), east coast fever (ECF) and African animal trypanosomiasis (ATT), in decreasing order, had the highest impact on livestock production. A Kruskal-Wallis test revealed a significant difference in FMD annual prevalence between cattle age groups (p < 0.001) and was the highest in animals > 4 years (median score of 32.5, range, 10-50). FMD had the highest impact on milk production, but based on veterinary costs (treatment costs), it was ranked second to CBPP. The study provides information on disease priorities that occur in the target zones in Mara ecosystem and which the local pastoralists must consider when accessing key ecosystem services such as water and pasture.

N2  - Background-aim: The Adult T-cell leukaemia/lymphoma (ATLL)is a mature T-cell neoplasm caused by the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). Among HTLV-1 carriers, the estimated frequency of ATLL is 2.5%. In Europe, the prevalence is very low. Strongyloidiasis is an infection due to soil-transmitted parasitic nematodes, mainly Strongyloides stercolaris. Life-threatening disease is rare, but HTLV-1 infection is a risk factor. Listeria monocytogenes is an important pathogen in immunocompromised individuals, and Listeriosis is more frequent in developed countries. Methods: Clinical data review and analysis. Results: 60 years old male, with a history of HTLV-1 and Hepatitis C infections. Came to the emergency room (ER)complaining of weight loss (5kg in 2 weeks), fatigue, abdominal pain, lower limb cramps, fever and diarrhea (4/5 dejections per day, yellowish, pasty, without blood or mucus), worsening the week prior to the visit to the ER. On admission stood out the presence of a distended and painful abdomen without palpable organomegaly, and 67.500/uL leukocytosis with 34.900/uL lymphocytosis, morphologically with marked lymphocytic pleomorphism, suggestive of Lymphoproliferative Disease, without anemia or thrombocytopenia. To complement the study, the patient underwent bone marrow aspiration for morphology and immunophenotyping (IF), and bone biopsy. In the context of the febrile syndrome study, we identified Listeria monocytogenes in the blood cultures and larvae of Strongyloides stercoralis in parasitological examination of feces. Thoraco-abdomino-pelvic computed tomography was performed, showing several supra and infradiaphragmatic adenopathic conglomerates, which the histological examination was compatible with T-cell lymphoma. The diagnosis of ATLL was confirmed by IF, showing a pathological population of T lymphocytes with: dimCD3+, cytCD3+, CD2+, CD7-, CD5+, CD4+, CD8-, CD25+. Due to worsening of the general condition, with multiorgan failure, the patient ended up dying. Conclusions: HTLV-1 is an important risk factor for the development of ATLL, a systemic disease with a very poor prognosis. On top of that, we must be aware of a possible overinfection in an already immunocompromised individual, that could worsen the bad prognosis in a small amount of time.

N2  - Infectious diseases are caused by pathogenic microorganisms and can be transmitted between individuals and populations thus threatening the general public health and potentially the economy. Efficient diagnostic tools are needed to provide accurate and timely guidance for case identification, transmission disruption and appropriate treatment administration. Point of care (POC) tests provide actionable results near the patient and thereby serve as a personal “radar”. In this review, we review clinical needs for POC testing for several major pathogens, including malaria parasites, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), human papillomavirus (HPV), dengue, Ebola and Zika viruses and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB). We compare different molecular approaches, including pathogen nucleic acid and protein, circulating microRNA and antibodies, used in the POC tests. Finally, we review recent advances in novel POC technologies focusing on microfluidic and plasmonic-based approaches.

N2  - Background. Acidosis in severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria is associated with high mortality, yet the pathogenesis remains incompletely understood. The aim of this study was to determine the nature and source of metabolic acids contributing to acidosis in patients with severe falciparum malaria. Methods. A prospective observational study was conducted to characterize circulating acids in adults with P. falciparum malaria (n = 107) and healthy controls (n = 45) from Bangladesh using high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolomics. Additional in vitro P. falciparum culture studies were performed to determine if parasites release the acids detected in plasma from patients with severe malaria acidosis. Results. We identified previously unmeasured plasma acids strongly associated with acidosis in severe malaria. Metabolomic analysis of P. falciparum parasites in vitro showed no evidence that these acids are released by the parasite during its life cycle. Instead, 10 of the plasma acids could be mapped to a gut microbial origin. Patients with malaria had low L-citrulline levels, a plasma marker indicating reduced gut barrier integrity. Longitudinal data showed the clearance of these newly identified acids was delayed in fatal cases. Conclusions. These data suggest that a compromise in intestinal barrier function may contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of life-threatening acidosis in severe falciparum malaria.

N2  - Southeast Asia is considered one of worldwide hotspots consisting many distinct zoonotic infections. With optimal condition for the development of various pathogens, Vietnam is facing serious risks of zoonotic diseases. Besides, more than 50% Vietnamese people settle in rustic areas and earn their livings through small-scale animal breeding. It is possible that zoonotic diseases can be easily spread to the population by close contact with the infected animals, their infected residues, contaminated water, soil, or other possible means of transmission. In fact, zoonotic infections—transmissible infections between vertebrate animals and humans—cover a wide range of diseases with distinctive clinical and epidemiological highlights. With insufficient understanding and swift alteration in toxicity of the pathogens, these infections have gained more concerns due to sophisticated routes of transmission and harmful threats to humans. Recently emerging viral diseases exerted potential dangers to human beings, which required many countries to impose immediate actions to prevent any complications. Vietnam has recorded several cases of zoonotic diseases, especially pig-related illnesses; however, the studies on these diseases in this country remain limited. This work aims to highlight the zoonotic diseases transferring from pigs to humans and discuss risk factors of these diseases in Vietnam.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The anarchic and poor controlled urbanization led to an increasing risk of mosquito-borne diseases (MBD) in many African cities. Here, we evaluate the spatial heterogeneity of human exposure to both malaria and arbovirus vectors in an urban area of Northern Senegal using antibody-based biomarkers of exposure to Anopheles and Aedes mosquito bites. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was undertaken during the rainy season of 2014 in four neighborhoods of the city of Saint-Louis, Northern Senegal. In each neighborhood, dry blood spots were performed in children aged 6-59 months and IgG responses to both gSG6-P1 (Anopheles) and Nterm-34kDa (Aedes) salivary peptides were evaluated as validated biomarkers of respective mosquito bite exposure. RESULTS: IgG response levels to gSG6-P1 and Nterm-34kDa salivary peptides varied significantly between the four neighborhoods (p<0.0001). The level of exposure to Aedes bites also varied according to sanitation (p=0.027) while that of Anopheles varied according to Insecticidal Treated Nets use (p=0.006). In addition, spatial clusters of high human-mosquitoes contact were identified inside three neighborhoods. CONCLUSIONS: Antibody-based biomarkers of exposure to Anopheles and Aedes mosquito bites could be helpful tools for evaluating the heterogeneity of exposure to malaria and arbovirus vectors by national control programs.

N2  - Background: Informed Consent (IC), a medical ethics cornerstone, dictates patients must be informed of treatment benefits and risks. Although transfusion risks of HIV and Hepatitis are largely mitigated, the risk of emerging pathogens, parasitic, and bacterial contamination persist. According to the FDA, Babesia and bacterial contamination represent the greatest infectious risks from blood transfusion today. At least 1:2,300 transfused platelet units contain bacteria, resulting in 1 symptomatic bacteremia per 10,000 transfusions and a fatality every 51,440 transfusions. The FDA estimates over 200 sepsis cases and 20 deaths/year. Objectives: The question is raised whether patients are adequately informed. Design/Method: An internet search engine was queried on April 1, 2018 with the phrases 'blood product informed consent' or 'transfusion informed consent', limited to PDF documents, pages hosted in the US, and excluded if they combined consent (i.e., surgical consent with a subsection on transfusion). Because several informed consent forms (ICFs) referred to a 'Patient Information Sheet', an additional query for this phrase was run. Infectious risks discussed were extracted from each eligible document. Results: Twenty-two (22) ICFs met review criteria. No ICF addressed risk differences across component type (i.e., platelets/plasma/RBC). Mean time since last ICF revision was 5y (range: 3m to 14y). Despite being the greatest transfusion-transmitted infection risk (∼1:2,300), less than half (9) of ICFs list bacteria; only 2 contained any risk magnitude information (RMI). In comparison, HIV infection (∼1:1,000,000) was presented in all ICFs, with RMI found in 10. Mention of Hepatitis was present in 1/3 (HepB) to 2/3 (HepC) with RMI ranges similar to HIV. Parasitic risks were mentioned in 3 and emerging pathogens in 1, without data on RMI. Some ICFs mentioned routine bacterial testing and culture, but none mentioned the pathogen-reduction or enhanced bacterial detection methods recommended by FDA Draft Guidances to reduce infection risk. Conclusion: Blood product IC varied greatly for transfusiontransmitted pathogen risks. None of the surveyed forms accurately represented the current FDA position on bacterial contamination and Babesia risks. ICFs that do not properly inform patients of current blood transfusion hazards or risk-reduction options may raise questions regarding medical ethics and potential for legal risk to providers. Transfusion medicine authorities (i.e. AABB and FDA) should offer specific, updated guidance on risk information for Informed Consent Forms.

N2  - Background-aim: Adenosine deaminase (ADA)is an enzyme that participates in the metabolism of purines and it is found mostly in lymphocytes. It is elevated in biological fluids in diseases such as tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, AIDS or liver disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of the adenosine deaminase determination in ascitic fluids for the diagnosis of different abdominal pathologies. Methods: Observational and retrospective study in which all the ascitic fluids in which ADA determination was requested in 2017 were analyzed. Ascitic fluids were classified into 4 groups according to the etiology: tumor, infectious, toxic or indeterminate. The final diagnosis data were consulted in the Clinical History of each patient. Results: 72 determinations of ADA in ascitic fluids were analyzed (35 infectious cases, 27 of tumoral cause, 6 of toxic cause and 4 without definitive diagnosis). Of all the samples, 69 (95.8%)presented a value lower than the established cut-off point as pathological (40 U/L), and in only 3 (4.2%)a result higher than 40 U/L was obtained. Of these three samples, one corresponded to a diagnosis of peritoneal tuberculosis (ADA: 95.5 U/L)and the other two were false positives that corresponded to a papillary urothelial carcinoma (ADA: 71.9 U/L)and a decompensation hydropic due to cirrhosis (ADA: 76.4 U/L). Conclusions: Based on the results obtained, an ADA value of <40 U/L would rule out a tuberculous problem. In our study, as in the literature consulted, it is shown that the ADA enzyme is a good market, due to its high sensitivity and specificity, for the peritoneal tuberculosis diagnosis. However, values higher than 40 U/L do not always indicate a tuberculous cause, and may cause false positive results, such as in certain neoplasms, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis or Chlamydia peritonitis. Therefore, we recommend limiting the ADA application to the suspicion of infectious diseases, avoiding its use in diseases of toxic or oncological causes.

N2  - Gastrointestinal diseases associated with impaired immunity are largely infectious, although an increased incidence of extranodal lymphoma is also found in the context of HIV infection. The range of such infections is related to the role of CD4+ T cells in their eradication. Infections tend to occur with organisms of limited virulence and to be recurrent, and are associated with disseminated infection. The symptoms they produce are usually pain on swallowing, weight loss or diarrhoea. Abdominal pain can be associated with Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare or sclerosis of the bile ducts secondary to infection.

N2  - In most species, variation in age among individuals is the strongest and most visible form of phenotypic variation. Individual-level age effects on disease traits, caused by differences in the age at exposure of the host or its parents, have been widely documented in invertebrates. They can influence diverse traits, such as host susceptibility, virulence, parasite reproduction and further transmission, and may cascade to the population level, influencing disease prevalence and within-host competition. Here, I summarize what is known about the relationship between individual-level age/stage effects and infectious disease in invertebrates. I also attempt to link age effects to the theory of aging (senescence), and highlight the importance of population age structure to disease epidemiology and evolution. I conclude by identifying gaps in our understanding of individual- and population-level age effects in invertebrates. As the age structure of populations varies across space and time, age effects have strong epidemiological, ecological, and evolutionary implications for explaining variation in infectious diseases of invertebrates.

N2  - Mosquitoes (Diptera; Culicidae) present a major threat to millions of people and animals worldwide, as they act as vectors for various pathogens, especially parasites and viruses. Resistance to insecticides, such as organophosphates and microbial control agents, and insufficient adherence to application guidelines are common reasons for insecticide treatment failure. Therefore, there is an urgent need for exploration of safer, cheaper, and more effective agents, with novel modes of action, to improve mosquito control. Biosynthesized nanoparticles (NPs) have recently been considered as a potential approach for combating vectors of malaria and also as a treatment for malaria. Here, we present current knowledge about the characterization and effectiveness of biogenic NPs against major vectors of malaria, including avian malaria (which may also provide useful insights on vectors of human malaria). This article is the first systematic review of the effects of biosynthesized nanoparticles on both malaria parasites (Plasmodium spp.) and relevant vectors.

N2  - The introduction of new therapeutic agents in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), including the new kinase inhibitors (KIs) ibrutinib and idelalisib, has changed the therapeutic landscape of the disease. The new KIs have also changed frequency and epidemiology of infections, that represent a major cause of morbidity and mortality of the disease. Hence, the great strides in the indications and use of new KIs need parallel amelioration of prophylaxis and supportive treatment for infections. Moving from the recognition that infection control represents an unmet need, the Italian Society of Hematology (SIE) convened a panel of experts who had published and/or expressed an interest in infection complications in CLL. The goal of the project was to provide practice recommendations for the management of the infectious complications of CLL during ibrutinib or idelalisib therapy. The present publication represents the results of a series of email correspondences and meetings held during 2017 and 2018. Three domains of infectious complications during KIs therapy for CLL were explored: risk assessment, risk management and risk monitoring. We hope these recommendations will help to minimize infectious adverse events, and we believe that an optimal management of them will be rewarded by better outcomes, and better quality of life.

N2  - Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) was firstly reported in Armenia in 1913. Following a considerable increase of the number of cases until the mid 1950s, the disease disappeared after 1969 and re-emerged in 1999. Scientific literature about VL in Armenia is available only in Russian or Armenian. This paper presents a historical overview about leishmaniasis in Armenia based on this literature as well as an epidemiological update since the re-emergence of the disease. In 1999-2016, 116 indigenous VL cases were recorded mainly in children in 8 of the 11 districts, however, VL is underreported because of lack of trained medical personal and diagnostic facilities. The aim of this work was to apply for the first time molecular diagnosis of VL in Armenia. Out of 25 VL suspected patients, 22 were positive by microscopy and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Genotyping using internal transcribed spacer 1-PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequencing identified the causative agent of VL in Armenia as Leishmania infantum. The present work is an important step towards the inclusion of molecular techniques in the current diagnosis of VL in Armenia and the establishment of local molecular diagnostic facilities.

N2  - Purpose: Periportal hyperechogenicity has been recorded in many inflammatory and infectious diseases, including viral hepatitis, inflammatory bowel diseases, toxic shock syndrome of staphylococcus infection, typhoid fever, and schistosomiasis. We aimed to evaluate the echogenicity of the portal tracts of the liver by abdominal ultrasound imaging in patients with fever irrespective of the cause. Methods: Abdominal ultrasound examination was performed in 277 consecutive patients presented with fever at their first visit and repeated 2 weeks later after their recovery. Results: Transient periportal hyperechogenicity was present in 39% (108 patients) of the feverish patients studied irrespective of the cause of the fever. Conclusion: Transient periportal hyperechogenicity is a frequent ultrasonographic finding in feverish patients irrespective of the cause of fever, and hence should not be misdiagnosed as liver disease or chronic periportal fibrosis unless the hyperechogenicity persists after recovery from the febrile or inflammatory condition.

N2  - Tuberculosis has led to more deaths worldwide than any other infectious disease for the past four years. The poor protection afforded by the Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine and the emergence of multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis strains warrant the development of alternative interventions. One such alternative is to prophylactically deliver aerosol containing bacteriophage D29, a lytic, parasitic virus receptor-restricted to infecting mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis. In this study, a nose-only inhalation device is adapted for use with a vibrating mesh nebulizer to deliver large amounts of active bacteriophage D29 aerosol, ∼1 pfu/alveolus, to the lungs of mice that subsequently receive either a high exposure, 50- 100 cfu, or a low exposure, 5-10 cfu, of M. tuberculosis H37Rv via a whole-body aerosol exposure system. Bacteriophage D29 remained present and active in the lungs for at least 90 minutes after exposure. Interestingly, pre-treatment with bacteriophage D29 aerosol significantly decreased the burden of M. tuberculosis in the lungs of mice (p < 0.05) evaluated 24 hours post-challenge. These results suggest that high doses of nebulized bacteriophage D29 aerosol may be worth exploring as a means of providing extra protection to health care professionals regularly exposed to patients with active tuberculosis and to individuals in areas with high rates of tuberculosis transmission.

N2  - Background Despite Taenia solium taeniosis/cysticercosis (TSTC) having been put high on the global agenda of neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), which over the last years has received a lot of attention, there has been no control programmes in place in sub-Saharan Africa, a highly endemic region. This could be attributed to lack of awareness of many stakeholders on the burden and impact of T. solium. This information is essential in guiding TSTC policies, practices and research agendas as well as encouraging cross-sectoral collaboration in the control of this important zoonotic parasite using a One Health approach. National elimination of the parasite is the foundation for global eradication. This will require that substantial country-level information is provided to all key stakeholders. We have mapped out TSTC research evidence in Tanzania to inform on disease burden and potential for integrated control measures. Methodology/Principal findings A scoping review of all TSTC studies undertaken in Tanzania and published up to December 2018 was conducted. The articles were searched from PUBMED, AJOL, Google Scholar and Google in general. Fifty-one (51) articles met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed. Prevalence of taeniosis of 2.3% - 5.2% was estimated based on copro-antigen ELISA while human cysticercosis of >16% was estimated based on serum antigen ELISA (Ag-ELISA) or IgG Western Blot. Neurocysticercosis (NCC) contributed significantly to epilepsy in adults. Farm prevalence of porcine cysticercosis were 6.0% - 17.4% (lingual examination) and 1.5% - 33.3% (Ag-ELISA). Slaughter-slab prevalence were 0% - 18.2% (routine meat inspection). Lacking latrines, watering pigs with river or pond water, and feeding pigs with potato peels were associated with porcine cysticercosis prevalence. Washing hands by dipping method increased the risk of human cysticercosis. In 2012, the number of DALYs/1000 person-years for NCC-associated epilepsy was 0.7 (95% UI, 0.2 1.6), around 5 million USD (95% UI, 797,535 16,933,477) were spent due to NCC-associated epilepsy and nearly 3 million USD (95% UI, 1,095,960 5,366,038) were potentially lost due to porcine cysticercosis. Three rounds of annual treatment of school-age children with praziquantel significantly reduced prevalence of taeniosis and porcine cysticercosis. Health education was efficacious in improving knowledge and attitudes favourable for control of TSTC while a single dose of oxfendazole 30 mg/kg body weight was efficacious in eliminating T. solium cysticerci from pig musculature. Conclusions/Significance The observed high burden of TSTC and the significant contribution of NCC to epilepsy in Tanzania warrant urgent interventions. Evaluation of best control options should make use of disease transmission dynamics models such as cystiSim, taking into account findings from the field based intervention studies. In addition, locally adapted management guidelines for people suffering from NCC are urgently needed.

N2  - Despite development of modern antiretrovirals with lower drug interaction potential than their predecessors, drug interaction challenges remain. Standard treatment regimens still require multiple antiretrovirals that may cause, or may be the target of, drug interactions. Additionally, people living with HIV are living longer and often present with comorbid conditions that require concomitant long-term drug therapy. Also, treatment of infectious diseases in resource-limited settings can result in significant interactions. In this review, we describe absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion pathways as they relate to relevant drug interactions with antiretrovirals along with the potential clinical consequences of these interactions. We highlight clinical data that illustrate pertinent interactions and provide tools to assist in predicting drug interactions in the absence of clinical data. Given these tools and thoughtful consideration of drug combinations, drug therapy in people living with HIV can be safely and effectively managed throughout their lifetime.

N2  - Background: Comprehensive and comparable estimates of health spending in each country are a key input for health policy and planning, and are necessary to support the achievement of national and international health goals. Previous studies have tracked past and projected future health spending until 2040 and shown that, with economic development, countries tend to spend more on health per capita, with a decreasing share of spending from development assistance and out-of-pocket sources. We aimed to characterise the past, present, and predicted future of global health spending, with an emphasis on equity in spending across countries. Methods: We estimated domestic health spending for 195 countries and territories from 1995 to 2016, split into three categories—government, out-of-pocket, and prepaid private health spending—and estimated development assistance for health (DAH) from 1990 to 2018. We estimated future scenarios of health spending using an ensemble of linear mixed-effects models with time series specifications to project domestic health spending from 2017 through 2050 and DAH from 2019 through 2050. Data were extracted from a broad set of sources tracking health spending and revenue, and were standardised and converted to inflation-adjusted 2018 US dollars. Incomplete or low-quality data were modelled and uncertainty was estimated, leading to a complete data series of total, government, prepaid private, and out-of-pocket health spending, and DAH. Estimates are reported in 2018 US dollars, 2018 purchasing-power parity-adjusted dollars, and as a percentage of gross domestic product. We used demographic decomposition methods to assess a set of factors associated with changes in government health spending between 1995 and 2016 and to examine evidence to support the theory of the health financing transition. We projected two alternative future scenarios based on higher government health spending to assess the potential ability of governments to generate more resources for health. Findings: Between 1995 and 2016, health spending grew at a rate of 4·00% (95% uncertainty interval 3·89–4·12) annually, although it grew slower in per capita terms (2·72% [2·61–2·84]) and increased by less than $1 per capita over this period in 22 of 195 countries. The highest annual growth rates in per capita health spending were observed in upper-middle-income countries (5·55% [5·18–5·95]), mainly due to growth in government health spending, and in lower-middle-income countries (3·71% [3·10–4·34]), mainly from DAH. Health spending globally reached $8·0 trillion (7·8–8·1) in 2016 (comprising 8·6% [8·4–8·7] of the global economy and $10·3 trillion [10·1–10·6] in purchasing-power parity-adjusted dollars), with a per capita spending of US$5252 (5184–5319) in high-income countries, $491 (461–524) in upper-middle-income countries, $81 (74–89) in lower-middle-income countries, and $40 (38–43) in low-income countries. In 2016, 0·4% (0·3–0·4) of health spending globally was in low-income countries, despite these countries comprising 10·0% of the global population. In 2018, the largest proportion of DAH targeted HIV/AIDS ($9·5 billion, 24·3% of total DAH), although spending on other infectious diseases (excluding tuberculosis and malaria) grew fastest from 2010 to 2018 (6·27% per year). The leading sources of DAH were the USA and private philanthropy (excluding corporate donations and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation). For the first time, we included estimates of China's contribution to DAH ($644·7 million in 2018). Globally, health spending is projected to increase to $15·0 trillion (14·0–16·0) by 2050 (reaching 9·4% [7·6–11·3] of the global economy and $21·3 trillion [19·8–23·1] in purchasing-power parity-adjusted dollars), but at a lower growth rate of 1·84% (1·68–2·02) annually, and with continuing disparities in spending between countries. In 2050, we estimate that 0·6% (0·6–0·7) of health spending will occur in currently low-income countries, despite these countries comprising an estimated 15·7% of the global population by 2050. The ratio between per capita health spending in high-income and low-income countries was 130·2 (122·9–136·9) in 2016 and is projected to remain at similar levels in 2050 (125·9 [113·7–138·1]). The decomposition analysis identified governments’ increased prioritisation of the health sector and economic development as the strongest factors associated with increases in government health spending globally. Future government health spending scenarios suggest that, with greater prioritisation of the health sector and increased government spending, health spending per capita could more than double, with greater impacts in countries that currently have the lowest levels of government health spending. Interpretation: Financing for global health has increased steadily over the past two decades and is projected to continue increasing in the future, although at a slower pace of growth and with persistent disparities in per-capita health spending between countries. Out-of-pocket spending is projected to remain substantial outside of high-income countries. Many low-income countries are expected to remain dependent on development assistance, although with greater government spending, larger investments in health are feasible. In the absence of sustained new investments in health, increasing efficiency in health spending is essential to meet global health targets. Funding: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

N2  - While co-infections are common in both wild and cultured fish, knowledge of the interactive effects of multiple pathogens on host physiology, gene expression and immune response is limited. To evaluate the impact of co-infection on host survival, physiology and gene expression, sockeye salmon Oncorhynchus nerka smolts were infected with the salmon louse Lepeophtheirus salmonis (V−/SL+), infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV; V+/SL−), both (V+/SL+), or neither (V−/SL−). Survival in the V+/SL+ group was significantly lower than the V−/SL− and V−/SL+ groups (p = 0.024). Co-infected salmon had elevated osmoregulatory indicators and lowered haematocrit values as compared to the uninfected control. Expression of 12 genes associated with the host immune response was analysed in anterior kidney and skin. The only evidence of L. salmonis-induced modulation of the host antiviral response was down-regulation of mhc I although the possibility of modulation cannot be ruled out for mx-1 and rsad2. Co-infection did not influence the expression of genes associated with the host response to L. salmonis. Therefore, we conclude that the reduced survival in co-infected sockeye salmon resulted from the osmoregulatory consequences of the sea lice infections which were amplified due to infection with IHNV.

N2  - A cross-sectional study was carried out on 594 bovines (341 buffalo adults, 31 buffalo calves, 163 cattle adults, and 59 cattle calves) to assess the exposure of native bovine population to T. evansi elicited trypanosomiasis in the low-lying areas of Punjab (India). We ruled out the endemicity of the disease with 10.77% (95%CI = 8.53–13.52) sero-positive and 23.56% (95%CI = 20.33–27.15) suspected cases by card agglutination assay. We have presented the spatial distribution of these cases as a guideline to local veterinary practitioners and policy-makers. The categorical assessment of risk factors revealed buffalo adults are the most susceptible group in the state despite insignificant differences in farm management practices. A significant increase in the WBC, platelet, AST and serum iron, and decrease in haemoglobin, haematocrit volume, and serum glucose was recorded in both T. evansi positive and suspected animals.

N2  - Background-aim: The Optilite Immunoglobulin E (IgE)assay quantitatively measures in vitro serum IgE using the Binding Site Optilite analyzer. This aids in the diagnosis of abnormal protein metabolism and a lack of ability to resist infectious agents. IgE is one of the 5 classes of immunoglobulins and is a characteristic Y shaped immunoglobulin, which is possible due to the disulphide bond adjoining 2 identical heavy chains and 2 identical light chains. It is believed IgE functions in parasite defense and is a mediator in type I hypersensitivity reactions. Increased serum concentrations of IgE can be seen in the following: parasitic infection, hyper-IgE syndrome, atopic diseases, diseases with T cell dysfunction, severe burns, certain malignant tumours and graft-versus-host disease. This immunoassay is useful for detection of IgE serum concentrations and diagnosis of atopic diseases. Harmless antigens (pollen, house dust mites)stimulate B cells to make specific IgE which bind to mast cells and this extends their half-life. The mast cell bound IgE are cross linked when in contact with the antigen again. The cell is degranulated and mediators are released. This causes symptoms of hay fever, asthma, and atopic eczema. Methods: Interference testing followed CLSI EP7-A2, using 5 potential interferents: rheumatoid factor (446.5 IU/mL), haemoglobin (575 IU/mL), unconjugated bilirubin (68.5 mg/dL), conjugated bilirubin (74.3 mg/dL)and Intralipid (176 mg/dL). A precision study was performed according to CLSI EP5-A2 over a period of 5 days using one reagent lot on one analyzer. The linearity study was based on CLSI EP06-A. The limit of quantitation (LoQ)was verified using a study based on CLSI EP17. Comparison was carried out using 144 samples. Results: No significant interference effects were observed. The between run precision coefficients of variation are: 5.34% at 84.8 IU/mL, 3.19% at 106.0 IU/mL, 1.66% at 240.3 IU/mL and 2.61% at 754.6 IU/mL. The assay was shown to be linear over a range of 3.6–1351.5lU/mL at the standard 1 + 4 dilution. LoQ for this assay was shown to be equivalent to the bottom of the overall measuring range, 10 IU/mL. Comparison showed good agreement in correlation to an alternative assay (Passing and Bablok y = 0.97× + 0.59, linear regression r = 0.999). Conclusions: Serum IgE can be reliably and precisely quantified via the Optilite IgE assay, which correlates well with existing methods.

N2  - Objective: The objective of this work was evaluate the cytotoxic, leishmanicidal and tripanocidal activity, as well as to evaluate its antimicrobial and modulatory activity in association with different antibiotics of the hydroethanolic extract of the Ximenia Americana stem bark (EHXA). Method: In vitro tests against Trypanosoma cruzi, Leishmania sp. and citotoxicity were performed. The evaluation of the antibacterial and bacterial resistance modulatory effect was given by the microdilution method. Results: The chemical profile show different classes of compounds with significant presence of quercetrin and caffeic acid. The EHXA demonstrated activity only in the concentration of 1000 μg/mL against the L. infantum and L. brasiliensis promastigotes, causing mortality percentage of 40.66 and 27.62%, respectively. The extract presented a significant toxicity only in the concentration of 1000 μg/mL, causing a mortality of 55.42% of fibroblasts. The antibacterial activity of the EHXA demonstrated a MIC value ≥1024 μg/mL against all the tested bacteria. However, in the modulation assay with EHXA in association with different antibiotics the extract had a synergistic effect against S. aureus strains when associated with norfloxacin. Conclusion: The results of this investigation demonstrate for the first time the chemical composition of the hydroethanolic extract of the Ximenia Americana stem bark, your potential antiparasitic and modulatory effect. The low cytotoxic and biological potential against S. aureus open therapeutic perspectives against leishmaniosis and bacterial infections.

N2  - The analysis of haptoglobin (Hp) serum concentration is a very sensitive, but non-specific, indicator of inflammation or infection. Methods to accurately diagnose infection in vivo in wildlife are usually constrained by low sensitivity due to the effects of stress on individual immune response and the challenging logistics of performing tests in the wild. Firstly, we sought to determine serum Hp concentration in red deer (Cervus elaphus) naturally infected with bovine tuberculosis (TB). Secondly, we assessed the complementary diagnostic value of serum Hp levels in conjunction with the cervical comparative skin test (CCT) performed in a subsample (n = 33). Serum Hp concentrations were significantly higher in TB-infected individuals (based on the presence of macroscopic lesions confirmed by culture) compared to those uninfected. In addition, serum Hp significantly changed with the type of animal handling, with captured and handled animals showing higher levels of Hp than hunted animals. Four out of 6 TB positive individuals that tested negative to the CCT (false negatives) showed Hp levels higher than the 95th percentile of healthy animals. These findings indicate that an acute phase response develops in animals with TB. In this paper, we demonstrate for the first time that an acute phase protein can provide a complementary assessment for specific diagnosis tests in wild species.

N2  - Clinically available synthetic chemotherapeutics to treat the vector-borne protozoan infection, leishmaniasis, are associated with serious complications such as toxicity and emergence of resistance. Natural products from plants consist of interesting biomolecules that may interfere with DNA or membrane integrity of the parasite and can possibly minimise the associated side effects. In the present study, various fractions of Euphorbia wallichii (EW) root extracts including n-hexane (EWNX), ethyl acetate (EWEA), chloroform (EWCH) and aqueous (EWAQ), were evaluated for their antileishmanial potential against Leishmania tropica followed by investigation of the possible mechanism of action via reactive oxygen species (ROS) quantification, membrane permeability (via sytox green dye) and apoptotic assay (via AO/EB method) using fluorescent microscopy. Two of the fractions i.e. EWEA and EWAQ inhibited the growth of promastigotes (IC50 7.8 and 10.2 μg/mL, respectively) and amastigotes (IC50 9.9 and 13.3 μg/mL, respectively) forms almost at similar concentrations as found for the standard antileishmanial drugs, tartar emetic (TA) and Glucantime (IC50 9.4 and 21.5 μg/mL, respectively). Both the active fractions remained non-toxic towards human blood erythrocytes and were able to cause membrane permeability and apoptotic induction (using Triton X-100 as a positive control) leading to death of Leishmania parasites. However, both the fractions could not triger significant and persistent ROS generation, compared to hydrogen peroxide used as a positive control. Antilesihmanial activity of the two active fractions might be attributed to the presence of high quantity of tannins and saponins.

N2  - Primary infection with Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) during pregnancy may cause congenital infection of the infant. This study evaluated whether screening using IgG avidity and multiplex-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods was effective for detecting a high-risk pregnancy for congenital T. gondii infection. In a prospective cohort study serum T. gondii IgG avidity was measured in 469 pregnant women who had a positive test for T. gondii antibody plus a positive or equivocal test for IgM. Multiplex-nested PCR for T. gondii DNA on amniotic fluid, maternal blood, and neonatal blood was performed with informed consent. Low (<30%), borderline (30–35%), and high (>35%) IgG avidity indices were found in 104 (22.2%), 30 (6.4%), and 305 (71.4%), respectively. A total of 12 cases had a positive PCR test for amniotic fluids of the prenatal amniocentesis or at birth, or neonatal blood. Seven of the 12 cases were diagnosed as having congenital T. gondii infection, and they had low IgG avidity indices. Congenital T. gondii infection screening using of IgG avidity and multiplex-nested PCR methods for pregnant women with a positive test for T. gondii antibody plus a positive or equivocal test for T. gondii IgM was useful for detecting a high-risk pregnancy and diagnosing congenital T. gondii infection.

N2  - Chytridiomycosis is an infectious disease of amphibians caused by the fungal species Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and B. salamandrivorans and has been implicated in the population decline of amphibian species worldwide. This case report describes a successful treatment protocol for chytridiomycosis in laboratory-maintained colonies of axolotls (Ambystoma mexicanum) and rough-skinned newts (Taricha granulosa). Over 12 mo, axolotls (n = 12) in a laboratory-reared colony developed multifocal erythematous dermatitis, mainly on the distal limbs and tails. Wild-caught newts handled by the same labpersonnel were housed in an adjacent room and occasionally presented with abdominal distension and lethargy. Differentials included poor water quality, pathogen infection, parasitic infestation, and trauma. Antibiotic treatment of animals according to results of bacterial culture and sensitivity, combined with bleach disinfection of aquaria, did not resolve clinical signs. Skin swabs from clinically affected axolotls submitted for a newly available commercial screen were positive for B. dendrobatidis. Additional PCR and sequencing analysis revealed chytrid-positive animals among group-housed newts in 2 clinically unaffected aquaria and suspected PCR-positives for 2 affected newt aquaria and an additional axolotl. Axolotls with skin lesions(n = 2) and newts with abdominal distension and lethargy (n = 2) underwent experimental treatment with itraconazole submersion (0.002% to 0.0025%; 5 min daily for 10 d). This pilot treatment was well tolerated and led to clinical resolution. Subsequent itraconazole treatment of the entire colony led to regrowth of extremities and restoration of normal coloration among axolotls. During treatment, the facility was decontaminated, and additional biosecurity measures were developed. PCR results after the pilot treatment and subsequent full-colony treatments (at 1 wk, 1 mo, and 6 mo after treatment) were negative for the presence of B. dendrobatidis. Because chytridiomycosis is a reportable animal disease in our state, colonies officially remained quarantined until negative PCR results were obtained at least 6 mo after treatment.

N2  - This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of glucantime and amphotericin B (AmB) encapsulated in niosome against cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) using in vitro and in vivo models. The niosomal formulations of the drugs alone and in combination were prepared and characterized. Subsequent to the examination of their cytotoxicity, their efficacy was evaluated using an in vitro MTT assay, macrophage model, flow cytometry, and gene expression profiling. For evaluation of therapeutic effect of niosomal combination on the lesion induced by Leishmania major in inbred BALB/c mice, the size of lesions and number of parasites in spleen was assessed. The niosomal formulations demonstrated significantly greater inhibitory effects compared with the non-niosomal forms when the IC50 was considered. The niosomal combination showed an increase in the apoptotic values and gene expression levels of IL-12 and metacaspase and a decrease in the levels of IL-10 with a dose-response effect. The niosomal combination was also effective in reducing the lesion size and splenic parasite burden in mice. Our findings indicated that there is a synergistic effect between AmB and glucantime in niosomal form in the inhibition of intracellular and extracellular forms of L. tropica. Additionally, the in vivo results on L. major suggest that topical niosomal formulation could be useful in the treatment of CL.

N2  - Background: In 2017, the Centre for Global Health (CGH) at the University of Oslo in collaboration with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) and the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad) held a meeting to discuss together with leading figures in disease control, research and development the issue of neglected tropical diseases and emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases. This commentary has taken up this discussion and the conclusions drawn at this meeting to make a case for the opportunity the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provide in highlighting the interconnectedness of factors that are relevant in the successful fight against neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) and emerging infectious diseases (EIDS). Main body: Despite NTDs being endemic and EIDS being epidemic, in order to prevent both disease groups effectively, it is important to appreciate that they share essential health determining factors, namely: neglect, poverty, a lack of access to clean water and sanitation facilities and an absence of or severely limited provision of healthcare as well as in many cases a zoonotic nature. Instead of looking to "simple disease management" for the answer, the SDGs help to understand the interplay of multiple priority areas and thereby help to promote a more holistic approach to addressing these two disease groups. Conclusions: Their commonalities mean that the Global Health community should leverage opportunities and efforts in the prevention and elimination of both NTDs and EIDs. Doing so using a One Health approach is considered to offer a "public health best-buy". Concrete solutions are proposed.

N2  - Traumatic myiasis causes substantial economic losses to farmers worldwide. In the present study, six flocks of sheep (2261 sheep) were investigated in Gansu, China, and 207 of 552 larvae were genetically characterized based on three genes, including cyt b, EF-1α, and white gene, by polymerase chain reaction and sequence analysis. A survey of sheep in China revealed that the prevalence of vulvar myiasis of six sheep flocks was 5.00% (11/220, Flock1), 4.85% (10/206, Flock2), 4.50% (9/200, Flock3), 5.00% (15/300, Flock4), 4.68% (15/320, Flock5), 0% (0/1015, Flock6), respectively. The sequence and phylogenetic analysis showed that only Wohlfahrtia magnifica was detected in the field samples. This is the first report of ovine vulvar myiasis caused by W. magnifica in Gansu, China. Some prophylactic measures are strongly recommended to reduce the risk of sheep acquiring traumatic myiasis in Gansu, China.

N2  - Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a rapid molecular technique that has been introduced into malaria diagnosis. The test is easy to perform and offers high sensitivity. We report a 53-year-old male patient who was hospitalized with fever attacks, chills, and headache caused 9 months after returning from Africa. During his stay in Africa, he used malaria chemoprophylaxis. Microscopy of thin and thick blood films and rapid diagnostic antigen testing remained negative for three times. The EDTA blood samples were tested using the Meridian illumigene® malaria LAMP assay that gave a positive result for Plasmodium spp. Diagnosis of malaria was subsequently specified as P. ovale infection by real-time PCR. Ovale malaria often manifests with delay and low parasitemia. The patient was treated with atovaquone-proguanil, followed by primaquine for prophylaxis of relapse. This case illustrates the usefulness of the illumigene® malaria LAMP assay for initial screening of malaria parasites.

N2  - Background: Onchocerciasis is caused by a nematode worm Onchocerca volvulus, which is transmitted in Sudan by black fly vectors of the Simulium damnosum sensu lato species complex. In Sudan, the disease is found in four foci where fast flowing rivers provide suitable breeding sites for the Simulium vector flies. The construction of dams and irrigation schemes for agricultural purposes has affected black fly breeding and distribution, such as in Merowe Dam in Abu-Hamed focus, where the perennially flowing water downstream of the Dam created new vector breeding sites, thereby, changing the pattern of disease transmission and creating public health problems. Based on this situation, this study was carried out to measure the effect of the Upper Atbara and Setit Dam complex on the distribution of Simulium damnosum s.l. breeding sites and on disease elimination in the Galabat sub-focus in eastern Sudan. Methods: Aquatic stages of Simulium were collected between October and November 2009, prior to the construction of the dam complex, and again in 2013 and 2015 while the dam complex construction was ongoing. Results: A total of 40 breeding sites were identified at the beginning of the study. After the construction of the dam complex in 2015, seventeen previously mapped breeding sites were inaccessible as they had been flooded by the dam complex's lake when reach its maximum size. Three species were obtained from different locations: S. damnosum s.l., S. griseicolle, and S. adersi. Conclusions: This study has shown a link between the construction of the dam complex and a reduction in the breeding sites of black fly vectors. This reduction has limited the Galabat sub-focus to a small area at the upper Atbara River which become the end of the focus. To sustain the success achieved in onchocerciasis control in the Galabat sub-focus, disease control and its vector control should be strengthened in the area cross-boarding Sudan and Ethiopia.

N2  - The transmission soil transmitted helminths (STH) occurs via ingestion of or contact with infective stages present in soil contaminated with human faeces. It follows therefore that efforts to reduce faecal contamination of the environment should help to reduce risk of parasite exposure and improvements in water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) are seen as essential for the long-term, sustainable control of STH. However, the link between WASH and STH is not always supported by the available evidence from randomised controlled trials, which report mixed effects of WASH intervention on infection risk. This review critically summarises the available trial evidence and offers an interpretation of the observed heterogeneity in findings. The review also discusses the implications of findings for control programmes and highlights three main issues which merit further consideration: intervention design, exposure assessment, and intervention fidelity assessment.

N2  - In a randomised trial comparing intermittent screening and treatment (IST) with dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) and intermittent preventive therapy against malaria in pregnancy (IPT) with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) in Malawi, the impacts of IST-DP and IPT-SP on the development and maintenance of malaria antibody immunity were compared. Pregnant Malawian women were randomised to receive IST-DP or IPT-SP. In a nested study, paired enrolment and delivery plasma samples from 681 women were assayed for antibodies against recombinant antigens and for IgG and opsonising antibodies to antigens found on infected erythrocytes (IEs). At delivery, antibody responses did not differ between study arms. Between enrolment and delivery, antibodies to recombinant antigens decreased, whereas antibodies to IEs including opsonising antibodies remained stable. Overall, changes in antibody responses over pregnancy did not differ by treatment arm. Stratifying by gravidity, antibody to schizont extract decreased more in multigravidae receiving IST-DP than IPT-SP. There was minimal impact of treatment arm on the development and maintenance of malaria immunity. While antibodies to recombinant antigens declined between enrolment and delivery, antibodies directed against IEs tended to be more stable, suggesting longer-lasting protection.Clinical trial registration: Pa n African Clinical Trials Registry (PACTR201103000280319) 14/03/2011.

N2  - The Plasmodium vivax Duffy-binding protein (DBP) is a prime target of the protective immune response and a promising vaccine candidate for P. vivax malaria. Naturally acquired immunity (NAI) protects against malaria in adults residing in infection-endemic regions, and the passive transfer of malarial immunity confers protection. A vaccine that replicates NAI will effectively prevent disease. Here, we report the structures of DBP region II in complex with human-derived, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies obtained from an individual in a malaria-endemic area with NAI. We identified protective epitopes using X-ray crystallography, hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, mutational mapping and P. vivax invasion studies. These approaches reveal that naturally acquired human antibodies neutralize P. vivax by targeting the binding site for Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC) and the dimer interface of P. vivax DBP. Antibody binding is unaffected by polymorphisms in the vicinity of epitopes, suggesting that the antibodies have evolved to engage multiple polymorphic variants of DBP. The human antibody epitopes are broadly conserved and are distinct from previously defined epitopes for broadly conserved murine monoclonal antibodies. A library of globally conserved epitopes of neutralizing human antibodies offers possibilities for rational design of strain-transcending DBP-based vaccines and therapeutics against P. vivax.

N2  - Background: The island of Hispaniola, shared by Haiti and the Dominican Republic (DR), is the only remaining malaria-endemic island in the Caribbean and accounts for 95% of the lymphatic filariasis (LF) burden in the Americas. Both countries aim to eliminate the diseases by 2020. Migration from Haiti, where both diseases are more prevalent, may promote transmission in the DR. Historically, Haitian migrant labourers live in rural Dominican agricultural 'company towns' called bateyes, many of which received mass drug administration (MDA) for LF elimination. This study sought to determine the prevalence of malaria and LF in bateyes of the DR and to describe related risk factors for disease. Methods: From March to April 2016, a cross-sectional, cluster survey was conducted across Dominican bateyes stratified into three regions: southwest, north and east. A household questionnaire (n = 776), captured demographics, ethnic origin, mobility patterns, malaria intervention coverage, and knowledge, and recent fever and treatment-seeking. Two individuals per household (n = 1418) were tested for malaria parasites by microscopy and rapid diagnostic test (RDT) and LF antigen by filariasis test strip (FTS). Population-level estimates and confidence intervals (CI) were computed adjusting for the survey design. Two-sided t-tests compared differences in knowledge scores. Results: No (0%) blood sample was Plasmodium-positive by microscopy or RDT. Six individuals were FTS-positive (0.5%; 95% CI: 0.2-1.5), but none (0%) of these were microfilariae-positive. Most batey residents were born in the DR (57.8%), documented (85.0%), and permanent residents (85.1%). Very few respondents (9.4%) reported travel to Haiti in the past year. Overall, half (53.8%) of respondents owned a bed net, and 82.3% of net owners reported using it the previous night. Indoor residual spraying (IRS) differed by region (range: 4.7%-61.2%). Most of those with recent fever sought care (56.0%), yet only 30.5% of those seeking care were tested for malaria. Compared to Dominican-born populations, Haitian-born respondents more frequently reported recent fever, did not seek care for the fever, had not heard of malaria, and could not name symptoms or prevention methods. Conclusions: Malaria and LF transmission appear absent or extremely low in Dominican bateyes, which are a mixture of Haitian and Dominican residents. Travel to Haiti is rare, meaning risk of malaria and LF importation is low. Addressing identified gaps in intervention coverage, malaria knowledge, treatment seeking and service delivery will improve the quality of surveillance for these diseases, particularly among marginalized populations and promote island-wide elimination.

N2  - Background: Drylands, which are among the biosphere's most naturally limiting and environmentally variable ecosystems, constitute three-quarters of the African continent. As a result, environmental sustainability and human development along with vector-borne disease (VBD) control historically have been especially challenging in Africa, particularly in the sub-Saharan and Sahelian drylands. Here, the VBD burden, food insecurity, environmental degradation, and social vulnerability are particularly severe. Changing climate can exacerbate the legion of environmental health threats in Africa, the social dimensions of which are now part of the international development agenda. Accordingly, the need to better understand the dynamics and complex coupling of populations and environments as exemplified by drylands is increasingly recognized as critical to the design of more sustainable interventions. Main body: This scoping review examines the challenge of vector-borne disease control in drylands with a focus on Africa, and the dramatic, ongoing environmental and social changes taking place. Dryland societies persisted and even flourished in the past despite changing climates, extreme and unpredictable weather, and marginal conditions for agriculture. Yet intrusive forces largely out of the control of traditional dryland societies, along with the negative impacts of globalization, have contributed to the erosion of dryland's cultural and natural resources. This has led to the loss of resilience underlying the adaptive capacity formerly widely exhibited among dryland societies. A growing body of evidence from studies of environmental and natural resource management demonstrates how, in light of dryland system's inherent complexity, these factors and top-down interventions can impede sustainable development and vector-borne disease control. Strengthening adaptive capacity through community-based, participatory methods that build on local knowledge and are tailored to local ecological conditions, hold the best promise of reversing current trends. Conclusions: A significant opportunity exists to simultaneously address the increasing threat of vector-borne diseases and climate change through methods aimed at strengthening adaptive capacity. The integrative framework and methods based on social-ecological systems and resilience theory offers a novel set of tools that allow multiple threats and sources of vulnerability to be addressed in combination. Integration of recent advances in vector borne disease ecology and wider deployment of these tools could help reverse the negative social and environmental trends currently seen in African drylands.

N2  - Background: Lymphatic filariasis is endemic in nine of the eleven Member States of the World Health Organization South East Asia Region. This article describes the intensive interventions with the National Programme for Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis in Thailand since its launch in 2001 till the validation of its elimination in 2017. Methods: A baseline epidemiological survey was initiated in 2001 to identify both brugian and bancroftian filarial areas and delineate its endemicity. Mass drug administration (MDA) with diethylcarbamazine citrate (DEC) and albendazole (ALB) was implemented in a total of 357 implementation units (IUs) in 11 lymphatic filariasis (LF) endemic provinces. The implementing unit (IU) was a sub-village. Stop-MDA surveys were conducted in 2006 in the 11 LF endemic provinces among population over 6 years of age and children of ≤6 years using immunochromatographic test (ICT) for Wuchereria bancrofti antigen and microfilariae (mf) detection for Brugia malayi. In Narathiwat province, Stop-MDA surveys were done in 2011 using ELISA. Transmission assessment surveys (TAS) were conducted in 2012-2013, 2015 and 2016-2017 among school students in the 6-7-year age-group. Surveillance of migrant populations through the national migrant health checkup were intensified in seven provinces over 2002-2017 for LF antigenaemia using ICT test cards. In four B. malayi endemic provinces, annual surveys to detect LF reservoir in domestic cats commenced in 1994. A 2001 survey of the chronic disease burden for LF established a register of the cumulative number of people with lymphedema/elephantiasis. Results: A total of five rounds of MDA annually were implemented over 2002-2006 in all IUs. Additional annual rounds of MDA were required in 87 IUs of Narathiwat province from 2007 to 2011 due to persistent infection. The annual national drug coverage with MDA over 2002-2012 was in the range of 68.0 to 95.4%. Stop-MDA surveys in 2006 in the 11 LF endemic provinces found nine mf positive cases in seven IUs in Narathiwat province with the highest prevalence of 0.8% (range: 0.1-0.8%). In Narathiwat TAS-1, TAS-2 and TAS-3 detected below transmission threshold rates for B. malayi mf among antibody positive children (0.3, 0.2 and 0.7% respectively). Contact tracing both all mf cases in all three TAS yielded no positive cases. Through the migrant health checkup, a total of 23 477 persons were tested, showing a positive rate of 0.7% (range: 0.1-2.7%) over years 2002-2017. In Narathiwat province, annual ivermectin treatment among cats commenced in 2003 resulting in a decline of mf prevalence among cats from 8.0% in 1995 to 0.8% in 2015. As of April 2017, a total of 99 lymphoedema/elephantiasis patients were registered and followed-up under 34 health facilities. Conclusions: Thailand over the years 2002 to 2011 conducted extensive MDA with high coverage rates. Through periodic and regular monitoring surveys it delineated LF transmission areas at sub-village level and demonstrated through its evaluation surveys - the Stop-MDA surveys and TAS, below transmission threshold rates that enabled its validation of LF elimination. In September 2017, World Health Organization acknowledged the Ministry of Health Thailand had eliminated lymphatic filariasis as a public health problem.

N2  - The most widespread form of malaria is caused by Plasmodium vivax. To replicate, this parasite must invade immature red blood cells through a process requiring interaction of the P. vivax Duffy binding protein (PvDBP) with its human receptor, the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines. Naturally acquired antibodies that inhibit this interaction associate with clinical immunity, suggesting PvDBP as a leading candidate for inclusion in a vaccine to prevent malaria due to P. vivax. Here, we isolated a panel of monoclonal antibodies from human volunteers immunized in a clinical vaccine trial of PvDBP. We screened their ability to prevent PvDBP from binding to the Duffy antigen receptor for chemokines, and their capacity to block red blood cell invasion by a transgenic Plasmodium knowlesi parasite genetically modified to express PvDBP and to prevent reticulocyte invasion by multiple clinical isolates of P. vivax. This identified a broadly neutralizing human monoclonal antibody that inhibited invasion of all tested strains of P. vivax. Finally, we determined the structure of a complex of this antibody bound to PvDBP, indicating the molecular basis for inhibition. These findings will guide future vaccine design strategies and open up possibilities for testing the prophylactic use of such an antibody.

N2  - INTRODUCTION: Ivermectin-based mass drug administration has emerged as a promising strategy for the control of scabies and impetigo in settings where the diseases are endemic. Current follow-up data are limited to 12 months for the majority of studies. Longer term data are vital to inform the sustainability of interventions. METHODS: We conducted a prevalence survey for scabies and impetigo in 10 villages in Choiseul province of the Solomon Islands 36 months after a single round of ivermectin and azithromycin mass drug coadministration. In the primary analysis we compared the prevalence of scabies and impetigo at 36 months to the prevalence at baseline. RESULTS: At 36 months the prevalence of scabies was 4.7% (95% CI 3.6-6.1) which was significantly lower than at baseline (18.7%, relative reduction 74.9%, 95% CI 61.5 - 87.7%, p < 0.001). The prevalence of impetigo was 9.6% (95% CI 8.1-11.4%), significantly lower than at baseline (24.7%, relative reduction 61.3%, 95% CI 38.7-100%, p < 0.001). The highest prevalence of scabies was amongst children aged less than 5 years (12.5%, adjusted odds ratio 33.2, 95% CI 6.6 - 603.2) and the highest prevalence of impetigo was among children aged 5-9 years (16.4% adjusted odds ratio 8.1, 95% CI 3.6-21.8). DISCUSSION: There was a sustained impact of a single round of ivermectin and azithromycin mass drug coadministration on the prevalence of scabies and impetigo three years after the intervention. Our data provide further support to adopt this intervention as a central component of global scabies control efforts.

N2  - People living in mining regions are exposed to numerous biological agents by several specific types of transmission mechanisms. This study is designed to describe fatal hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) cases confirmed by serology and molecular analysis, where a seroprevalence survey was conducted in the gold mining regions of the state of Mato Grosso, in the official Amazon region, Brazil. Two fatal cases of HPS were confirmed in a mining area in the Legal Amazon, where malaria is one of the most important public health problems. A molecular analysis detected the presence of the genome of the Castelo dos Sonhos virus. Out of the 112 blood samples analyzed, five were positive for Plasmodium infection (four P. falciparum and one P. vivax), and four were seropositive for hantavirus, showing a seroprevalence of 3.57%. One of the four miners who was seroreactive for hantavirus concomitantly had P. falciparum infection, which was confirmed by thick blood smear. This manuscript highlights the importance of considering hantavirus pulmonary syndrome as a diagnostic possibility in febrile infection associated with pulmonary manifestations in mining areas where malaria cases are often identified.

N2  - BACKGROUND: The impact of preexisting immunity on the efficacy of artemisinin combination therapy must be examined to monitor resistance, and for implementation of new treatment strategies. METHODS: Serum samples obtained from a clinical trial in Western Kenya randomized to receive artemether-lumefantrine (AL) or artesunate-mefloquine (ASMQ) were screened for total immunoglobulin G against preerythrocytic and erythrocytic antigens. The association and correlation between different variables, and impact of preexisting immunity on parasite slope half-life (t½) was determined. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in t½, but the number of individuals with lag phase was significantly higher in the AL than in the ASMQ arm (29 vs 13, respectively; P < .01). Circumsporozoite protein-specific antibodies correlate positively with t½ (AL, P = .03; ASMQ, P = .09), but negatively with clearance rate in both study arms (AL, P = .16; ASMQ, P = .02). The t½ correlated negatively with age in ASMQ group. When stratified based on t½, the antibody titers against circumsporozoite protein and merozoite surface protein 1 were significantly higher in participants who cleared parasites rapidly in the AL group (P = .01 and P = .02, respectively). CONCLUSION: Data presented here define immunoprofiles associated with distinct responses to 2 different antimalarial drugs, revealing impact of preexisting immunity on the efficacy of artemisinin combination therapy regimens in a malaria-holoendemic area.

N2  - Background: Chagas disease is a protozoan infection caused by Trypanosoma cruzi. The disease has a chronic course in which 20-30% of the patients would develop progressive damage to the cardiovascular system and the gastrointestinal tube. We are still unable to predict who will develop end-organ damage but there are some acquired and genetic risk factors already known. Results: We reviewed data from 833 patients with serologically confirmed Chagas disease in this retrospective study. Patients were classified as siblings or non-siblings (controls) and the results of pre-treatment blood PCR assay, end-organ damage (cardiac and/or gastrointestinal), and the presence of delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) skin involvement in patients treated with benznidazole were analyzed. Siblings were grouped by family and we randomly generated groups of 2 or 3 persons with the remaining controls. We classified the results of each variable as concordant or discordant and compared the concordance in these results among the sibling groups with that among control groups. We identified 71 groups of siblings and randomly generated 299 groups of non-related patients. Pre-treatment blood PCR concordance was significantly higher (19%) among siblings compared to controls (P = 0.02), probably due to a higher frequency in pre-treatment positive results. No other statistically significant differences were found. Conclusions: A significant difference was found in the concordance of pre-treatment blood PCR for T. cruzi among siblings compared to non-related controls.

N2  - Background: Information on insecticide resistance and the mechanisms driving it in the major malaria vectors is grossly lacking in Niger Republic, thus hindering control efforts. To facilitate evidence-based malaria control, the role of Anopheles coluzzii population from southern Niger, in malaria transmission, its insecticides resistance profile and the molecular mechanisms driving the resistance were characterized. Methods: Blood fed female Anopheles gambiae sensu lato resting indoor were collected at Tessaoua, Niger. Source of blood was established using PCR and infection with Plasmodium determined using TaqMan assay. Resistance profile was established with the major public health insecticides, and resistance intensity determined with deltamethrin. Synergist assays were conducted with piperonyl butoxide and diethyl maleate. Presence of L1014F and L1014S knockdown resistance (kdr) mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) was investigated using TaqMan genotyping, and strength of selection pressure acting on the Anopheles populations determined by assessing the genetic diversity of a fragment spanning exon-20 of the VGSC from alive and dead females. Results: High human blood index (96%) and high Plasmodium falciparum infection (~ 13%) was observed in the An. coluzzii population. Also, a single mosquito was found infected with Plasmodium vivax. High pyrethroid and organochloride resistance was observed with mortalities of less than 20% for deltamethrin, permethrin, α-cypermethrin, and DDT. A high LD50 (156.65 min) was obtained for deltamethrin, with a resistance ratio of ~ 47.18 compared to the susceptible Ngoussou colony. Moderate carbamate resistance was observed, and a full susceptibility to organophosphates recorded. Synergist bioassays with piperonyl butoxide and diethyl maleate significantly recovered deltamethrin and DDT susceptibility, respectively implicating CYP450 s (mortality = 82%, χ2 = 84.51, p < 0.0001) and glutathione S-transferases (mortality = 58%, χ2 = 33.96, p < 0.001) in resistance. A high frequency of 1014F kdr mutation (82%) was established, with significant difference in genotype distribution associated with permethrin resistance [odds ratio = 7.71 (95% CI 2.43-14.53, χ2 = 13.67, p = 0.001]. Sequencing of intron-1 of the voltage-gated sodium channel (VGSC) revealed a low genetic diversity. Conclusion: High pyrethroid resistance highlight the challenges to the effectiveness of the pyrethroids-based ITNs and indoor residual spraying (IRS) against An. coluzzii in Niger. The pyrethroids-synergists LLINs and organophosphate-based IRS maybe the alternatives for malaria control in southern Niger.

N2  - Background: HIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy (ART) require treatment with artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) when infected with malaria. Artemether-lumefantrine (AL) is the most commonly used ACT for treatment of falciparum malaria in Africa but there is limited evidence on the safety and efficacy of AL in HIV-infected individuals on ART, among whom drug-drug interactions are expected. Day-42 adequate clinical and parasitological response (ACPR) and incidence of adverse events was assessed in HIV-infected individuals on efavirenz-based ART with uncomplicated falciparum malaria treated with AL. Methods: A prospective, open label, non-randomized, interventional clinical trial was conducted at St Paul's Hospital in northern Zambia, involving 152 patients aged 15-65 years with uncomplicated falciparum malaria, who were on efavirenz-based ART. They received a 3-day directly observed standard treatment of AL and were followed up until day 63. Day-42 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-corrected ACPRs (95% confidence interval [CI]) were calculated for the intention-to-treat population. Results: Enrolled patients had a baseline geometric mean (95% CI) parasite density of 1108 (841-1463) parasites/μL; 16.4% (25/152) of the participants had a recurrent malaria episode by day 42. However, PCR data was available for 17 out of the 25 patients who had malaria recurrence. Among all the 17 patients, PCR findings demonstrated malaria re-infection, making the PCR-adjusted day-42 ACPR 100% in the 144 patients who could be evaluated. Even when eight patients with missing PCR data were considered very conservatively as failures, the day-42 ACPR was over 94%. None of the participants, disease or treatment characteristics, including day-7 lumefantrine concentrations, predicted the risk of malaria recurrence by day 42. AL was well tolerated following administration. There were only two cases of grade 3 neutropaenia and one serious adverse event of lobar pneumonia, none of which was judged as probably related to intake of AL. Conclusions: AL was well tolerated and efficacious in treating uncomplicated falciparum malaria in HIV co-infected adults on efavirenz-based ART. However, a higher than anticipated proportion of participants experienced malaria re-infection, which highlights the need for additional malaria prevention measures in this sub-population after treatment with AL.

N2  - The diversity of Trypanosoma cruzi parasites infecting humans is still poorly understood. We used deep sequencing to analyze this diversity in chagasic patients from Mexico. Such information is crucial to understand transmission cycles and to identify determinants of epidemiological and clinical characteristics of the infection. We analyzed parasite mini-exon spliced-leader sequences following amplification of blood DNA by polymerase chain reaction and deep sequencing. Chagasic patients presented a diverse assemblage of parasite haplotypes covering TcI, TcII, TcV, and TcVI discrete typing units, with a mean (±SEM) of 3.9 ± 0.7 haplotypes/patient, and 47% harbored infections with multiple discrete typing units. Most parasite haplotypes from patients were identical or similar to those for Triatoma dimidiata from the same region, confirming their local circulation. Infection with multiple T. cruzi strains may influence serological diagnostic test results and disease progression in patients and should be taken into account to evaluate associations between parasite diversity and clinical aspects of T. cruzi infections.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Neutrophil activation results in Plasmodium parasite killing in vitro, but neutrophil products including neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) mediate host organ damage and may contribute to severe malaria. The role of NETs in the pathogenesis of severe malaria has not been examined. METHODS: In Papua, Indonesia, we enrolled adults with symptomatic Plasmodium falciparum (n = 47 uncomplicated, n = 8 severe), Plasmodium vivax (n = 37), or Plasmodium malariae (n = 14) malaria; asymptomatic P falciparum (n = 19) or P vivax (n = 21) parasitemia; and healthy adults (n = 23) without parasitemia. Neutrophil activation and NETs were quantified by immunoassays and microscopy and correlated with parasite biomass and disease severity. RESULTS: In patients with symptomatic malaria, neutrophil activation and NET counts were increased in all 3 Plasmodium species. In falciparum malaria, neutrophil activation and NET counts positively correlated with parasite biomass (Spearman rho = 0.41, P = .005 and r2 = 0.26, P = .002, respectively) and were significantly increased in severe disease. In contrast, NETs were inversely associated with parasitemia in adults with asymptomatic P falciparum infection (r2 = 0.24, P = .031) but not asymptomatic P vivax infection. CONCLUSIONS: Although NETs may inhibit parasite growth in asymptomatic P falciparum infection, neutrophil activation and NET release may contribute to pathogenesis in severe falciparum malaria. Agents with potential to attenuate these processes should be evaluated.

N2  - In a study from the onchocerciasis-endemic area of Mahenge in southern Tanzania, Mmbando et al. [Inf Dis Poverty. 2018;7:64] demonstrate that in four selected villages the overall epilepsy prevalence was high, and significantly more elevated in the two villages of higher onchocerciasis endemicity compared to those of lower endemicity. This is replicating earlier findings from many other areas of tropical Africa. The authors are also providing data indicating that in the Mahenge focus, the prevalence of nodding syndrome may be related to that of onchocerciasis in the same way as epilepsy in general. The application of a clinical case definition for onchocerciasis-Associated epilepsy (OAE) as used in the study of Mmbando et al. [Inf Dis Poverty. 2018;7:64] faces some difficulties; indeed, its precision in discerning cases of OAE from epilepsy due to other etiologies is not known, and it does not allow for a specific diagnosis in the individual patient. Because an operational surveillance tool for assessing the number of patients in the population could mean substantial advance for better estimating the burden of OAE, the proposed definition should be tried in different settings and its performance reviewed in the process.

N2  - Background: Patients with X-linked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) are protected against invasive bacterial infections due to IgG replacement therapy, but are still at higher risk for mucosal infections of the gut and respiratory tract. This might be explained by to the lack of IgA and IgM, as these antibodies are especially important for protection against invading bacterial pathogens on the mucosal surface. Methods: In an attempt to eliminate a chronic norovirus infection in a patient with X-linked agammaglobulinemia, fresh frozen plasma (FFP) was given two times a week for 3 weeks. At each visit, pre- and post-FFP infusion serum and saliva was collected to determine IgG-, IgA- and IgM-concentrations and serum half-life was calculated. Functionality of the immunoglobulins pre- and post-FFP infusion in both serum and saliva was tested by measuring complement activation, agglutination and killing of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi). Results: Administration of FFP failed to eradicate the chronic norovirus infection. Serum IgA and IgM half-life was 4.2 ± 0.3 and 3.8 ± 0.3 days, respectively. The presence of serum IgM was associated with increased complement binding and complement-mediated killing of NTHi. IgA in saliva was detectable post-FFP and was associated with increased agglutination of NTHi. IgM in saliva was not detectable. Conclusions: We conclude that FFP treatment, although ineffective in clearing a chronic norovirus infection in this single patient, might be beneficial to prevent or eliminate bacterial infections in XLA patients by increasing IgM dependent complement-mediated killing in serum and IgA dependent bacterial agglutination on the mucosal surface.

N2  - During a disease outbreak, affected fish exhibit particular clinical signs, and the task in veterinary diagnostics is to identify the causative agent(s) as a prerequisite for appropriate treatment measures. In this study, we present an outbreak of a multifactorial gill disease in a cohort of ornamental koi Cyprinus carpio with gill necrosis as the main exterior clinical sign. By means of pathogen identification and determining pathogen abundance in various tissues, mortality of individual fish was found to be caused by different agents. Three out of 5 diseased individuals suffered from koi herpesvirus disease (KHVD) associated with a systemic infection with cyprinid herpesvirus 3 (CyHV-3), 1 fish succumbed to koi sleepy disease (KSD) caused by a high carp edema virus (CEV) load in the gills co-infected with CyHV-3 and flavobacteria, and the last fish had low loads of both viruses but high flavobacteria and Ichthyobodo burdens and most likely died from an interaction of these bacterial and parasitic agents. The results indicated that correct identification of the agent responsible for the observed clinical signs or mortality during co-infection might require quantitative determination of the abundance of the pathogens as well as detailed knowledge of the infection biology of these pathogens.

N2  - A reduction in the global burden of malaria over the past two decades has encouraged efforts for regional malaria elimination. Despite the need to target all Plasmodium species, current focus is mainly directed towards Plasmodium falciparum, and to a lesser extent P. vivax. There is a substantial lack of data on both global and local transmission patterns of the neglected malaria parasites P. malariae and P. ovale spp. We used a species-specific real-time PCR assay targeting the Plasmodium 18s rRNA gene to evaluate temporal trends in the prevalence of all human malaria parasites over a 22-year period in a rural village in Tanzania.We tested 2897 blood samples collected in five cross-sectional surveys conducted between 1994 and 2016. Infections with P. falciparum, P. malariae, and P. ovale spp. were detected throughout the study period, while P. vivax was not detected. Between 1994 and 2010, we found a more than 90% reduction in the odds of infection with all detected species. The odds of P. falciparum infection was further reduced in 2016, while the odds of P. malariae and P. ovale spp. infection increased 2- and 6-fold, respectively, compared to 2010. In 2016, non-falciparum species occurred more often as mono-infections. The results demonstrate the persistent transmission of P. ovale spp., and to a lesser extent P. malariae despite a continued decline in P. falciparum transmission. This illustrates that the transmission patterns of the non-falciparum species do not necessarily follow those of P. falciparum, stressing the need for attention towards non-falciparum malaria in Africa. Malaria elimination will require a better understanding of the epidemiology of P. malariae and P. ovale spp. and improved tools for monitoring the transmission of all Plasmodium species, with a particular focus towards identifying asymptomatic carriers of infection and designing appropriate interventions to enhance malaria control.

N2  - The present study investigated the presence of endo- and ecto-parasites, and vector-borne pathogens, in dogs from four islands of Greece. A total of 200 (123 owned and 77 sheltered) dogs were examined with different microscopic, serological and molecular methods. Of the examined dogs, 130 (65%) were positive for one or more parasites and/or vector-borne pathogens. The most common zoonotic intestinal helminths recorded were Ancylostomatidae (12.5%) and Toxocara canis (3.5%). Ninety-three dogs (46.5%) seroreacted to Rickettsia conorii. Twenty-two (11%) of them were also PCR positive and 7 (3.5%) showed corpuscles suggestive of Rickettsia spp. on the blood smears. Nineteen dogs (9.5%) were seropositive for Ehrlichia canis, three of them being also PCR positive. Dogs positive for Anaplasma phagocytophilum-Anaplasma platys (1%), Dirofilaria immitis (0.5%) and Babesia canis (0.5%) were also found. Fleas and ticks were recorded in 53 (26.5%) and 50 (25%) dogs, respectively, and all specimens were identified as Ctenocephalides felis felis and Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu lato. Binary multiple univariate Generalized Linear Models were used to investigate factors and clinical signs related to the recorded positivity, while the association of specific signs with the pathogens was evaluated using tests of independence. Knowledge of occurrence and impact of zoonotic parasites and vector-borne pathogens in dog populations is crucial to prevent the infection in animals and people, and to control the risk of spreading of these pathogens in endemic and non-endemic areas.

N2  - Background. The prevalence of allergy-related diseases is increasing in low-income countries. Parasitic helminths, common in these settings, may be protective. We hypothesized that intensive, community-wide, anthelminthic mass drug administration (MDA) would increase allergy-related diseases, while reducing helminth-related morbidity. Methods. In an open, cluster-randomized trial (ISRCTN47196031), we randomized 26 high-schistosomiasis-transmission fishing villages in Lake Victoria, Uganda, in a 1:1 ratio to receive community-wide intensive (quarterly single-dose praziquantel plus albendazole daily for 3 days) or standard (annual praziquantel plus 6 monthly single-dose albendazole) MDA. Primary outcomes were recent wheezing, skin prick test positivity (SPT), and allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (asIgE) after 3 years of intervention. Secondary outcomes included helminths, haemoglobin, and hepatosplenomegaly. Results. The outcome survey comprised 3350 individuals. Intensive MDA had no effect on wheezing (risk ratio [RR] 1.11, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64-1.93), SPT (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.85-1.42), or asIgE (RR 0.96, 95% CI 0.82-1.12). Intensive MDA reduced Schistosoma mansoni infection intensity: the prevalence from Kato Katz examinations of single stool samples from each patient was 23% versus 39% (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.55-0.88), but the urine circulating cathodic antigen test remained positive in 85% participants in both trial arms. Hookworm prevalence was 8% versus 11% (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.31-1.00). There were no differences in anemia or hepatospenomegaly between trial arms. Conclusions. Despite reductions in S. mansoni intensity and hookworm prevalence, intensive MDA had no effect on atopy, allergy-related diseases, or helminth-related pathology. This could be due to sustained low-intensity infections; thus, a causal link between helminths and allergy outcomes cannot be discounted. Intensive community-based MDA has a limited impact in high-schistosomiasis-transmission fishing communities, in the absence of other interventions.

N2  - Rationale: Strongyloides stercoralis (S. stercoralis) is an intestinal nematode with a complicated life cycle that can involve the gastrointestinal system. Infected patients are generally asymptomatic; but if symptomatic, the symptoms will include skin rash, respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Patient concerns: A 77-year old man presented with edema of the lower extremities and insignificant tenderness in the epigastric region. Diagnosis: The histopathology of gastric tissue showed severe inflammation and multiple ulcers in the cardia, antrum and proximal duodenum. A large number of rhabditiform larvae of S. stercoralis along with tissue hyperemia and infiltration of lymphoplasma cells, eosinophils, and neutrophils were found. Intervention: Treatment with albendazole. Outcome: Despite the albendazole treatment, the patient's condition deteriorated and eventually died because of a sepsis-like syndrome. Lesson: Physicians should remain alert to the urgency due to threadworm, especially among the elderly people and immunosuppressed cases; and should ensure accurate diagnosis, suitable treatment and careful follow-up of these cases.

N2  - An effective pathogen has the ability to evade the immune response. The strategies used to achieve this may be based on the direct action of virulence factors or on the induction of host factors. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are immune cells with an incredible ability to suppress the inflammatory response, which makes them excellent targets to be exploited by pathogenic bacteria, viruses, or parasites. In this review, we describe the origin and suppressive mechanisms of MDSCs, as well as their role in chronic bacterial, viral, and parasitic infections, where their expansion seems to be essential in the chronicity of the disease. We also analyze the disadvantages of current MDSC depletion strategies and the different in vitro generation methods, which can be useful tools for the deeper study of these cells in the context of microbial infections.

N2  - Entamoeba histolytica is a cosmopolitan pathogenic parasite. It is spread via the feco-oral route and, to a lesser extent, via sexual intercourse. We report a case of hepatic and intestinal amoebiasis in a 67-year-old man who had never travelled to an endemic area. Abdominal CT investigations detected two liver abscesses and chronic colitis. Positive amoebic serology and a positive PCR test for E. histolytica in the hepatic liquid and faeces confirmed the diagnosis. Curative metronidazole and tiliquinol-tilbroquinol were administered successfully. The patient had been contaminated through heterosexual intercourse with his healthy French female partner who was a carrier of the parasite. Though unusual, amoebiasis as a result of sexual transmission should be considered in non-endemic areas in people who have never travelled abroad, particularly in the presence of clinical symptoms such as liver abscesses or chronic diarrhoea.

N2  - Background: Literature on health events in HIV-infected travellers is scarce, particularly in sub-Saharan African (SSA) migrants. Methods: We investigated health events in HIV-infected SSA migrants living in France during and after travel to their native country. All had a pre-travel plasma viral load (pVL) below 200 copies/mL and were on stable combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). Logistic regression models were used to assess the risk factors for at least one adverse health event or febrile event. Results: Among 264 HIV migrants, pre-travel median CD4 count was 439/mm3 and 27 migrants (6%) experienced a low-level viremia between 50 and 200 copies/mL. One hundred (38%) experienced at least one event (13 experienced two events). The most common events were gastrointestinal, including diarrhoea (n = 29, 26%), respiratory events (n = 20, 18%), and malaria (n = 17, 15%; 1 death). In multivariable analysis, a pre-travel low-level viremia and a lack of pre-travel medical advice significantly increased the risk for any event (OR 4.31, 95% CI, 1.41–13.1; and OR 3.62, 95% CI, 1.38–9.47; respectively). A lack of pre-travel advice significantly increased the risk for febrile event. Conclusions: Early and tailored counselling on pre-travel medical advice regarding diarrhoea and vector-borne diseases prophylactic measures in HIV-infected SSA migrants should be emphasised before travel to Africa.

N2  - Imported cases of anthroponotic cutaneous leishmaniasis due to Leishmania tropica are increasingly documented in Europe. We investigated the ability of Phlebotomus perniciosus, a competent vector of Leishmania infantum widespread in southwestern Europe, to support the growth and transmissibility of an Asian strain of L. tropica recently isolated from a refugee. Parasite growth behavior was investigated in laboratory-reared sand flies fed artificially with promastigotes as well as in sand flies infected after biting on footpad lesions induced in hamsters by promastigote inoculation. The evolution of infection was checked by gut microscopy and quantitative real-time PCR, and it was found to be similar between promastigote- and amastigote-initiated infections. In 80% of infected sand flies, despite survival and flourishing growth of promastigotes after blood digestion and defecation, either the parasites died, or failed to migrate to the foregut and/or to mature into infective forms. However, in the remaining 20% L. tropica developed into abundant metacyclic promastigotes. The quantitative real-time PCR assay detected variable loads of gut promastigotes irrespective of morphological evidence of viability or progressive/final death. Parasite transmissibility was investigated by exposing naive hamsters to P. perniciosus previously infected on chronic lesions induced in hamsters which survived to take a second blood meal. Two months post exposure, lesions developed in skin sites bitten by sand flies confirmed to harbor metacyclic promastigotes; in the following months, the presence of viable and transmissible L. tropica parasites in lesions was demonstrated by xenodiagnosis assays. Our findings support the hypothesis that, in particular epidemiological situations, P. perniciosus may play the role of an occasional L. tropica vector.

N2  - Triatomine vectors transmit Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease in humans. Transmission to humans typically occurs when contaminated triatomine feces come in contact with the bite site or mucosal membranes. In the Southern Cone of South America, where the highest burden of disease exists, Triatoma infestans is the principal vector for T. cruzi. Recent studies of other vector-borne illnesses have shown that arthropod microbiota influences the ability of infectious agents to colonize the insect vector and transmit to the human host. This has garnered attention as a potential control strategy against T. cruzi, as vector control is the main tool of Chagas disease prevention. Here we characterized the microbiota in T. infestans feces of both wild-caught and laboratory-reared insects and examined the relationship between microbial composition and T. cruzi infection using highly sensitive high-throughput sequencing technology to sequence the V3-V4 region of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene on the MiSeq Illumina platform. We collected 59 wild (9 with T. cruzi infection) and 10 lab-reared T. infestans (4 with T. cruzi infection) from the endemic area of Arequipa, Perú. Wild T. infestans had greater hindgut bacterial diversity than laboratory-reared bugs. Microbiota of lab insects comprised a subset of those identified in their wild counterparts, with 96 of the total 124 genera also observed in laboratory-reared insects. Among wild insects, variation in bacterial composition was observed, but time and location of collection and development stage did not explain this variation. T. cruzi infection in lab insects did not affect α- or β-diversity; however, we did find that the β-diversity of wild insects differed if they were infected with T. cruzi and identified 10 specific taxa that had significantly different relative abundances in infected vs. uninfected wild T. infestans (Bosea, Mesorhizobium, Dietzia, and Cupriavidus were underrepresented in infected bugs; Sporosarcina, an unclassified genus of Porphyromonadaceae, Nestenrenkonia, Alkalibacterium, Peptoniphilus, Marinilactibacillus were overrepresented in infected bugs). Our findings suggest that T. cruzi infection is associated with the microbiota of T. infestans and that inferring the microbiota of wild T. infestans may not be possible through sampling of T. infestans reared in the insectary.

N2  - Background. In holoendemic areas, children suffer the most from Plasmodium falciparum malaria, yet newborns and young infants express a relative resistance to both infection and severe malarial disease (SM). This relative resistance has been ascribed to maternally-derived anti-parasite immunoglobulin G; however, the targets of these protective antibodies remain elusive. Methods. We enrolled 647 newborns at birth from a malaria-holoendemic region of Tanzania. We collected cord blood, measured antibodies to Plasmodium falciparum Schizont Egress Antigen-1 (PfSEA-1), and related these antibodies to the risk of severe malaria in the first year of life. In addition, we vaccinated female mice with PbSEA-1, mated them, and challenged their pups with P. berghei ANKA parasites to assess the impact of maternal PbSEA-1 vaccination on newborns' resistance to malaria. Results. Children with high cord-blood anti-PfSEA-1 antibody levels had 51.4% fewer cases of SM compared to individuals with lower anti-PfSEA-1 levels over 12 months of follow-up (P = .03). In 3 trials, pups born to PbSEA-1-vaccinated dams had significantly lower parasitemia and longer survival following a P. berghei challenge compared to pups born to control dams. Conclusions. We demonstrate that maternally-derived, cord-blood anti-PfSEA-1 antibodies predict decreased risk of SM in infants and vaccination of mice with PbSEA-1 prior to pregnancy protects their offspring from lethal P. berghei challenge. These results identify, for the first time, a parasite-specific target of maternal antibodies that protect infants from SM and suggest that vaccination of pregnant women with PfSEA-1 may afford a survival advantage to their offspring.

N2  - Objective: In this study, we evaluated the effectiveness of photodynamic therapy (PDT) for the treatment of experimental cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) and the profile of macrophages activation markers. Background: Leishmaniasis is an infectious disease caused by parasites of the genus Leishmania. CL is caused by Leishmania major in the old world and by Leishmania braziliensis in the Americas. Considering the targeted organs, PDT may constitute a valuable therapeutic intervention. Macrophages are the host cells of Leishmania in mammals and may be classified into type M1 or M2 depending on the pattern of activation. Methods: BALB/c mice were infected in the foot pad with 1 × 106 amastigotes of L. braziliensis and treated with 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), visible light, or 5-ALA-PDT. The ex vivo mRNA expression levels of interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), arginase-1, heme oxygenase ( Hmox), and induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were quantities as markers of macrophage activation with distinct ability to kill intracellular parasite. Results: The parasite load decreased significantly in the group treated with PDT compared with the other groups. The iNOS relative mRNA was higher in the group treated with PDT and light only compared with the group without treatment, whereas iNOS/arginase ratio was significantly higher only in the PDT group. The expression of TNF-α was significantly higher in 5-ALA and light compared with PDT and control group. No significant difference was observed in the expression of the other markers evaluated. Conclusions: Both, light and 5-ALA-PDT were able to upregulate iNOS expression only; 5-ALA-PDT was able to reduce parasite burden. The increase in the iNOS levels suggests it might participate in the antimicrobial mechanisms triggered by 5-ALA-PDT; although parasite death mechanism was not completely clarified, the results presented in this study suggest that macrophage activation may contribute to parasite control.

N2  - Re-emerging diseases outbreaks are being reported in Venezuela since 2012/13, following ongoing political and economic crisis. Healthcare system collapse has led to an increasing incidence and mortality from communicable diseases. Increasing movement of people between Venezuela and the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA) creates a need for increased awareness of the infectious disease risks and requirements for appropriate investigation and treatment of individuals arriving from Venezuela; overall risk for EU/EEA citizens is low.

N2  - Background: Chagas disease is an important health problem in Latin America. Relatives of T. cruzi seropositive donors could also test positive in serological assays. Therefore, the study of Chagas diseases in family clusters has become important to accurately evaluate the problem that this infectious disease represents. Objective: to investigate family cluster from blood donors, their serological, clinical and epidemiological status. Methods: 53 family clusters consisting of index case and a variable number of relatives were studied. All the participants had ELISA and Western blot assays, as well as, clinical tests including an electrocardiogram and chest x ray. Results: We found that 24.52% of the family clusters had at least one T. cruzi seropositive family member, in addition to the blood donor. Importantly, 20.75% of the index cases and 5.0% of the relatives presented pathological manifestations associated to Chagas disease. Several epidemiological conditions are associated to being T. cruzi seropositive. Conclusion: blood donor's family clusters have several seropositive to T. cruzi members. Mother-child pairs were also seropositive, suggesting vertical transmition. Pathological symptom associated to Chagas Diseases were present in index cases and family member. These results highlight the importance of studying family clusters to clarify the true magnitude of Chagas disease in Mexico.

N2  - Sparganosis is a rare zoonotic parasitosis that is sporadically reported worldwide. In Australia, the causative tapeworms are considered endemic in wildlife animals, however, there have been only five reported human infections. We present three additional cases of sparganosis, involving two Australian born gentlemen who have never travelled overseas and a woman who emigrated from Ethiopia. The first man presented with two unusual subcutaneous lumps that migrated along the anterior abdominal wall connected by a tunnel. The second man presented with two separate lumps, one on the thigh and the other on the left upper abdomen over a 4-week interval. The woman presented with 6 weeks of intermittent fevers, night sweats, abdominal pain and passing intestinal worms. This series of patients suggests that sparganosis is under-recognised in Australia and serves as a reminder for clinicians to the varied presentations that can be characteristic of this lesser known zoonosis.

N2  - Background: Updated data regarding the epidemiology of imported malaria in Italy are needed. The aim of this study is to evaluate trends in incidence and associated lethality of malaria episodes and to consider if there has been an increase in paediatric cases in the region of Tuscany. Methods: All malaria cases diagnosed from 2000 to 2017 in 31 Tuscan hospitals were retrospectively identified. Epidemiological data regarding hospitalization rates and lethality for malaria in paediatric and adult population were described. Results: Among the 1102 retrieved cases of malaria (134 children and 968 adults). Plasmodium falciparum was the most commonly reported species (67%). The overall hospitalization rate was of 1.69 cases per 100,000 population/year. Hospitalization rate in the total population decreased from 2000 to 2009 (p < 0.01) and increased from 2009 to 2017 (p < 0.01), similar trends were observed in adults and children. However, in 2010–2017, the cumulative child group incidence of 1.78 per 100,000 surpassed that of the adult group of 1.53 per 100,000 (p < 0.01). Fifteen deaths occurred, all of them in adults, giving a crude lethality rate of 1.36%. Conclusions: In Tuscany, malaria is still a health concern in terms of both morbidity and mortality. Educational actions and pre-travel advice must be promoted.

N2  - The clinical presentation of severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria differs between children and adults, but the mechanistic basis for this remains unclear. Contributing factors to disease severity include total parasite biomass and the diverse cytoadhesive properties mediated by the polymorphic var gene parasite ligand family displayed on infected erythrocytes. To explore these factors, we performed a multicohort analysis of the contribution of var expression and parasite biomass to severe malaria in two previously published pediatric cohorts in Tanzania and Malawi and an adult cohort in India. Machine learning analysis revealed independent and complementary roles for var adhesion types and parasite biomass in adult and pediatric severe malaria and showed that similar var profiles, including upregulation of group A and DC8 var, predict severe malaria in adults and children. Among adults, patients with multiorgan complications presented infections with significantly higher parasite biomass without significant differences in var adhesion types. Conversely, pediatric patients with specific complications showed distinct var signatures. Cerebral malaria patients showed broadly increased expression of var genes, in particular group A and DC8 var, while children with severe malaria anemia were classified based on high transcription of DC8 var only. This study represents the first large multisite meta-analysis of var expression, and it demonstrates the presence of common var profiles in severe malaria patients of different ages across distant geographical sites, as well as syndrome-specific disease signatures. The complex associations between parasite biomass, var adhesion type, and clinical presentation revealed here represent the most comprehensive picture so far of the relationship between cytoadhesion, parasite load, and clinical syndrome.IMPORTANCEP. falciparum malaria can cause multiple disease complications that differ by patient age. Previous studies have attempted to address the roles of parasite adhesion and biomass in disease severity; however, these studies have been limited to single geographical sites, and there is limited understanding of how parasite adhesion and biomass interact to influence disease manifestations. In this meta-analysis, we compared parasite disease determinants in African children and Indian adults. This study demonstrates that parasite biomass and specific subsets of var genes are independently associated with detrimental outcomes in both childhood and adult malaria. We also explored how parasite var adhesion types and biomass play different roles in the development of specific severe malaria pathologies, including childhood cerebral malaria and multiorgan complications in adults. This work represents the largest study to date of the role of both var adhesion types and biomass in severe malaria.

N2  - Echinococcus granulosus is the parasite responsible for cystic echinococcosis (CE), an important worldwide-distributed zoonosis. New effective vaccines against CE could potentially have great economic and health benefits. Here, we describe an innovative vaccine design scheme starting from an antigenic fraction enriched in tegumental antigens from the protoscolex stage (termed PSEx) already known to induce protection against CE. We first used mass spectrometry to characterize the protein composition of PSEx followed by Gene Ontology analysis to study the potential Biological Processes, Molecular Functions, and Cellular Localizations of the identified proteins. Following, antigenicity predictions and determination of conservancy degree against other organisms were determined. Thus, nine novel proteins were identified as potential vaccine candidates. Furthermore, linear B cell epitopes free of posttranslational modifications were predicted in the whole PSEx proteome through colocalization of in silico predicted epitopes within peptide fragments identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-TOF/TOF. Resulting peptides were termed "clean linear B cell epitopes," and through BLASTp scanning against all nonhelminth proteins, those with 100% identity against any other protein were discarded. Then, the secondary structure was predicted for peptides and their corresponding proteins. Peptides with highly similar secondary structure respect to their parental protein were selected, and those potentially toxic and/or allergenic were discarded. Finally, the selected clean linear B cell epitopes were mapped within their corresponding 3D-modeled protein to analyze their possible antibody accessibilities, resulting in 14 putative peptide vaccine candidates. We propose nine novel proteins and 14 peptides to be further tested as vaccine candidates against CE.

N2  - FCRL5+ atypical memory B cells (atMBCs) expand in many chronic human infections, including recurrent malaria, but studies have drawn opposing conclusions about their function. Here, in mice infected with Plasmodium chabaudi, we demonstrate expansion of an antigen-specific FCRL5+ population that is distinct from previously described FCRL5+ innate-like murine subsets. Comparative analyses reveal overlapping phenotypic and transcriptomic signatures between FCRL5+ B cells from Plasmodium-infected mice and atMBCs from Plasmodium-exposed humans. In infected mice, FCRL5 is expressed on the majority of antigen-specific germinal-center-derived memory B cells (MBCs). Upon challenge, FCRL5+ MBCs rapidly give rise to antibody-producing cells expressing additional atypical markers, demonstrating functionality in vivo. Moreover, atypical markers are expressed on antigen-specific MBCs generated by immunization in both mice and humans, indicating that the atypical phenotype is not restricted to chronic settings. This study resolves conflicting interpretations of atMBC function and suggests FCRL5+ B cells as an attractive target for vaccine strategies. FCRL5+ atypical memory B cells (MBCs) expand in many chronic human diseases. Using tetramers to track rare antigen-specific cells, Kim et al. show that FCRL5+ MBCs are mature, optimally responsive cells that arise not only in response to infection and protein immunization in mice but also to immunization in humans.

N2  - AIM: Despite high pathogen burden and malnutrition in low-income settings, knowledge on relationship between asymptomatic viral or parasitic infections, nutrition and growth is insufficient. We studied these relationships in a cohort of six month old Malawian infants. METHODS: As part of a nutrient supplementation trial for 12 months, we documented disease symptoms of 840 participant daily and anthropometric measurements every three months. Stool specimens were collected every six months and analysed for Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium species and enterovirus, rotavirus, norovirus, parechovirus and rhinovirus using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The prevalence of the microbes was compared to the children's linear growth and the dietary. RESULTS: The prevalence of the microbes was similar in every intervention group. All age-groups combined, children negative for Giardia lamblia had a mean standard deviation (SD) of -0.01 (0.49) change in length-for-age Z-score (LAZ), compared to -0.12 (0.045) among Giardia lamblia positive children (difference -0.10, 95% CI -0.21 to -0.00, p=0.047). The LAZ change difference was also statistically significant (p=0.042) at age of 18-21 months but not at the other time-points. CONCLUSION: Asymptomatic Giardia lamblia infection was mainly associated with growth reduction in certain three-month periods. The result refers to the chronic nature of Giardia lamblia infection.

N2  - Schistosomiasis is a water-based, infectious disease with high morbidity and significant economic burdens affecting >250 million people globally. Disease control has, with notable success, for decades focused on drug treatment of infected human populations, but a recent paradigm shift now entails moving from control to elimination. To achieve this ambitious goal, more sensitive diagnostic tools are needed to monitor progress toward transmission interruption in the environment, especially in low-intensity infection areas. We report on the development of an environmental DNA (eDNA)-based tool to efficiently detect DNA traces of the parasite Schistosoma mansoni directly in the aquatic environment, where the nonhuman part of the parasite life cycle occurs. This is a report of the successful detection of S. mansoni in freshwater samples by using aquatic eDNA. True eDNA was detected in as few as 10 cercariae per liter of water in laboratory experiments. The field applicability of the method was tested at known transmission sites in Kenya, where comparison of schistosome detection by conventional snail surveys (snail collection and cercariae shedding) with eDNA (water samples) showed 71% agreement between the methods. The eDNA method furthermore detected schistosome presence at two additional sites where snail shedding failed, demonstrating a higher sensitivity of eDNA sampling. We conclude that eDNA provides a promising tool to substantially improve the environmental surveillance of S. mansoni. Given the proper method and guideline development, eDNA could become an essential future component of the schistosomiasis control tool box needed to achieve the goal of elimination.

N2  - Background: Quinine (QN) remains an effective drug for malaria treatment. However, quinine resistance (QNR) in Plasmodium falciparum has been reported in many malaria-endemic regions particularly in African countries. Genetic polymorphism of the P. falciparum Na+/H+ exchanger (pfnhe1) is considered to influence QN susceptibility. Here, ms4760 alleles of pfnhe1 were analysed from imported African P. falciparum parasites isolated from returning travellers in Wuhan, Central China. Methods: A total of 204 dried-blood spots were collected during 2011-2016. The polymorphisms of the pfnhe1 gene were determined using nested PCR with DNA sequencing. Results: Sequences were generated for 99.51% (203/204) of the PCR products and 68.63% (140/204) of the isolates were analysed successfully for the pfnhe1 ms4760 haplotypes. In total, 28 distinct ms4760 alleles containing 0 to 5 DNNND and 1 to 3 NHNDNHNNDDD repeats were identified. For the alleles, ms4760-1 (22.86%, 32/140), ms4760-3 (17.86%, 25/140), and ms4760-7 (10.71%, 15/140) were the most prevalent profiles. Furthermore, 5 undescribed ms4760 alleles were reported. Conclusions: The study offers an initial comprehensive analysis of pfnhe1 ms4760 polymorphisms from imported P. falciparum isolates in Wuhan. Pfnhe1 may constitute a good genetic marker to evaluate the prevalence of QNR in malaria-endemic and non-endemic regions.

N2  - Toxoplasma gondii is a neurotropic pathogen with worldwide distribution. To evaluate the association between Toxoplasma infection and the risk of epilepsy by meta-analysis, observational peer-reviewed studies were retrieved from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus and Google Scholar (up to 10 October 2018) and by reference review. Pooled risk estimates were calculated using a random effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochrane's Q-test and I2. In total, 16 eligible studies involving 19 data sets were included for the final analysis. A total 7897 participants (3771 epileptic patients, 4026 healthy controls) were included. The pooled odds ratio (OR) for Toxoplasma infection was increased to 1.72 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.37 to 2.16) among patients with epilepsy. There was moderate heterogeneity among the studies (χ2=39.8, I2=62.3%, p=0.001). The ORs from subgroup analyses showed that both cryptogenic epilepsy (OR 2.65 [95% CI 1.91 to 3.68]) and active convulsive epilepsy (OR 1.37 [95% CI 1.09 to 1.72]) were significantly associated with Toxoplasma infection. Another subgroup analyses according to age showed a significant positive association in children (OR 1.33), adults (OR 1.57) and in all ages (OR 1.89). Our findings support the association between Toxoplasma infection and epilepsy. More prospective studies with larger sample sizes and more experimental studies are recommended to elucidate a causative relationship.

N2  - Background: Lymphatic filariasis (LF) in advanced stage is a clinically challenging disability resulting in poor quality of life. In advanced stage of filariasis, medical management is seldom effective and few surgical procedures are beneficial. In this study, we assessed clinical efficacy of a surgical technique combining vascularized lymph node transfer (VLNT) and serial excision for patients affected by advanced LF. Patients and Methods: A total of 17 patients with grades 2 and 3 lower limb lymphedema after three consecutive humanitarian missions in India between 2014 and 2018 underwent excision of excessive soft tissue of leg and supraclavicular lymph node flap transferred to dorsum of foot. Recipient vessels were prepared and microanastomosis was performed. Lymphedema was assessed by measuring leg circumferences at different levels, episodes of infectious lymphangitis, and lymphoscintigraphy. Results: A significant decrease of lower limb circumference measurements at all levels was noted postoperatively. Postoperative lymphoscintigraphy revealed reduced lymph stasis. One patient suffered of a seroma on donor site. Six patients had partial loss of skin graft over the flap at recipient site and it was managed by regrafting. Data analysis observed statistically significant reduction in feeling of heaviness (p < 0.005) and episodes of acute lymphangitis after surgery. Conclusion: Advanced LF of leg is difficult to manage using traditional medical treatment. The combination of VLNT and surgical excision provided a safe and reliable approach to treat this debilitating disease.

N2  - Background: The echinococcosis is prevalent in 10 provinces /autonomous region in western and northern China. Epidemiological survey of echinococcosis in China in 2012 showed the average prevalence of four counties in Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) is 4.23%, much higher than the average prevalence in China (0.24%). It is important to understand the transmission risks and the prevalence of echinococcosis in human and animals in TAR. Methods: A stratified and proportionate sampling method was used to select samples in TAR. The selected residents were examined by B-ultrasonography diagnostic, and the faeces of dogs were tested for the canine coproantigen against Echinococcus spp. using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The internal organs of slaughtered domestic animals were examined by visual examination and palpation. The awareness of the prevention and control of echinococcosis among of residents and students was investigated using questionnaire. All data were inputted using double entry in the Epi Info database, with error correction by double-entry comparison, the statistical analysis of all data was processed using SPSS 21.0, and the map was mapped using ArcGIS 10.1, the data was tested by Chi-square test and Cochran-Armitage trend test. Results: A total of 80 384 people, 7564 faeces of dogs, and 2103 internal organs of slaughtered domestic animals were examined. The prevalence of echinococcosis in humans in TAR was 1.66%, the positive rate in females (1.92%) was significantly higher than that in males (1.41%), (χ 2 = 30.31, P < 0.01), the positive rate of echinococcosis was positively associated with age (χ 2trend = 423.95, P < 0.01), and the occupational populations with high positive rates of echinococcosis were herdsmen (3.66%) and monks (3.48%). The average positive rate of Echinococcus coproantigen in TAR was 7.30%. The positive rate of echinococcosis in livestock for the whole region was 11.84%. The average awareness rate of echinococcosis across the region was 33.39%. Conclusions: A high prevalence of echinococcosis is found across the TAR, representing a very serious concern to human health. Efforts should be made to develop an action plan for echinococcosis prevention and control as soon as possible, so as to control the endemic of echinococcosis and reduce the medical burden on the population.

N2  - Malaria-related mortality has a very high association with poverty rates, and the disease is most prevalent in low- A nd middle-income countries. To achieve the malaria-specific targets of the Sustainable Development Goals, malaria-endemic countries and development partners need to take concerted action to reduce malaria cases and deaths. Reaching all affected communities with malaria interventions requires strong political commitment and a significant expansion of international and domestic financial resources. World Malaria Day 2019 is an opportunity to review progress and challenges in this field.

N2  - Background: The geographical distribution of intestinal parasites with conditions of poverty in most countries of sub-Saharan Africa coincides with that of HIV/AIDS. However, there is paucity of studies investigating the relationship between intestinal parasitic infections with CD4 counts and anemia in HIV/AIDS patients starting Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) in this region particularly and in Ethiopia in general. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections in relation to CD4 count and anemia among ART-initiated patients in St. Mary Aksum General Hospital, Tigray, Ethiopia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among randomly selected 242 ART-initiated participants during February to April 2017 in St. Mary Aksum General hospital. Data was collected using structured questionnaire and laboratory examination. Logistic regression was applied to assess any association between explanatory factors and outcome variables (P values < 0.05). Result: The overall prevalence of intestinal parasites was 26.4% and among the six types of parasitic genera identified Entamoeba histolytica/dispar (18.6%) and Giardia lamblia (2.1%) were the leading. According to the multivariate analysis, lack of hand washing before meal, eating uncooked vegetables, history of taking anti-parasite medication, stool consistency, and anemia were strongly associated with intestinal parasitosis. Conclusion: There was a high prevalence of intestinal parasites among HIV positive individuals. Intervention measures such as deworming, improving hygiene and sanitation practices should be strengthened to reduce the burden of intestinal parasites among people living with HIV.

N2  - Plasmodium falciparum remains a serious public health problem and a continuous challenge for the immune system due to the complexity and diversity of the pathogen. Recent advances from several laboratories in the characterization of the antibody response to the parasite have led to the identification of critical targets for protection and revealed a new mechanism of diversification based on the insertion of host receptors into immunoglobulin genes, leading to the production of receptor-based antibodies. These advances have opened new possibilities for vaccine design and passive antibody therapies to provide sterilizing immunity and control blood-stage parasites.

N2  - Parasitic infection risks in domestic animals may increase as a result of outdoor activities, often leading to transmission events to and from owners, other domestic animals and wildlife. Furthermore, outdoor access has not been quantified in domestic animals as a risk factor with respect to latitude or parasite transmission pathway. Cats are an ideal model to test parasitic infection risk in outdoor animals because there have been many studies analysing this risk factor in this species; and there is a useful dichotomy in cat ownership between indoor-only cats and those with outdoor access. Thus, we used meta-analysis to determine whether outdoor access is a significant risk factor for parasitic infection in domestic pet cats across 19 different pathogens including many relevant to human, domestic animal and wildlife health, such as Toxoplasma gondii and Toxocara cati. Cats with outdoor access were 2.77 times more likely to be infected with parasites than indoor-only cats. Furthermore, absolute latitude trended towards significance such that each degree increase in absolute latitude increased infection likelihood by 4%. Thus, restricting outdoor access can reduce the risk of parasitic infection in cats and reduce the risk of zoonotic parasite transmission, spillover to sympatric wildlife and negative impacts on feline health.

N2  - Background: Intestinal parasitic infections (IPIs) have been major public health problems in low income countries primarily affecting school children. Previous studies in Ethiopia have shown high burden of intestinal parasitic infections in most children. In order to gain a deeper insight into the magnitude of the problem more information is needed from different localities where similar studies have not been conducted. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of IPIs and associated risk factors among school children in Jawi Primary School, Jawi town, north -west Ethiopia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from April to June 2017 to assess the prevalence of IPIs and associated risk factors among Jawi Primary School children, Ethiopia. A total of 422 children were selected using age-stratified systematic random sampling technique. Stool samples were examined microscopically using direct wet-mount and formal-ether concentration techniques. A structured questionnaire was used to obtain information regarding the associated risk factors. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20 and p value < 0.05 was taken as statistically significant. Results: Of 406 students examined for IPIs, 235 (57.88%) were positive for one or more intestinal parasites. Single, double and triple infections were 41.9, 6.2 and 1.2%, respectively. Overall infection rate was slightly higher in males (51.85%) than in females (45.30%) though the difference was not significant. Higher prevalence rate (about 51-53%) was recorded among 6 to 18 years old children. Prevalence of Giardia lamblia was the highest (19.95%), followed by hookworm (13.8%), Schistosoma mansoni (10.3%), Entamoeba histolytica/dispar (5.9%), Hymenolepsis nana (4.2%), Taenia species (3%) and Ascaris lumbricoides (0.73%), in that order. Among the risk factors assessed, age, hand washing habit before meals, open field defecation habit, consistency of wearing shoes, habit of eating raw and unwashed vegetables, and finger nail cleanliness and trimming habit were found to be the most important predictors associated with high risk of IPIs (p < 0.05). Conclusion: High prevalence of IPIs among Jawi Primary school children demands improved health education on regular hand washing, latrine use, wearing shoes, cleaning finger nails, not crossing rivers with bare foot and avoiding eating raw vegetables.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Culex species are widespread across Cameroon and responsible for high burden of nuisance in most urban settings. However, despite their high nuisance, they remain less studied compared to anophelines. The present study aimed to assess Culex species distribution, susceptibility to insecticide, bionomics and role in Lymphatic Filariasis (LF) transmission in the city of Yaoundé. METHODS: Mosquito collections were conducted from March to December 2017 using Centre for Disease Control light traps (CDC-LT), human landing catches (HLC) and larval collections. Mosquitoes were identified using morphological identification keys. Mosquitoes from the Culex pipiens complex were further identified using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) to assess the presence of sibling species. Bioassays were conducted with 2-5 day-old unfed females to assess mosquito susceptibility to DDT, permethrin, deltamethrin and bendiocarb following WHO guidelines. Dead, control and surviving mosquitoes from bioassays were screened by PCR to detect the presence of knockdown resistance (kdr) alleles. Pools of mosquitoes were examined by PCR to detect the presence of Wuchereria bancrofti. RESULTS: A total of 197,956 mosquitoes belonging to thirteen species were collected. The density of mosquito collected varied according to the collection methods, districts and seasons. Culex quinquefasciatus emerged as the most abundant and the only species of the Culex pipiens complex in Yaoundé. Culex species were found breeding in different types of breeding sites including polluted and unpolluted sites. All Culex species including Cx antennatus, Cx duttoni, Cx perfuscus and Cx tigripes were found to be highly resistant to permethrin, deltamethrin and DDT. Culex quinquefasciatus was also found to be resistant to bendiocarb. A high frequency of the West Africa kdr allele was recorded in resistant Cx. quinquefasciatus. Out of the 247 pooled samples of 25 Culex spp. examined for the presence of Wuchereria bancrofti, none was found infected. CONCLUSION: The study confirms the high adaptation of Culex species particularly Culex quinquefasciatus to the urban environment and no implication of this species in the transmission of LF in Yaoundé Cameroon. Culex species predominance in urban settings highlight potential transmission risk of West Nile and rift valley fever in Yaoundé.

N2  - Background Self-treatment with antimicrobials is common in sub-Saharan Africa. Little is known about the prevalence of this practice where malaria transmission intensity is low, and little is known about the prevalence of self-treatment with other medications such as antihypertensives and antihyperglycemics. Methods A two-stage randomized population-based cluster survey with selection proportional to population size was performed in northern Tanzania. Self-identified healthcare decision-makers from randomly selected households were asked to report instances of self-medication without a prescription in the preceding year. Associations between self-treatment and sociodemographic characteristics were assessed with Pearson's chi-squared and the Student's t-test. Results A total of 718 participants completed the survey, and 344 (47.9%) reported any household member obtaining medication without a prescription. Of these, 85 (11.8%) obtained an antimicrobial and four (0.6%) obtained an antihypertensive or antihyperglycemic. Of respondents reporting self-treatment, 306 (89.0%) selected the medication themselves. Self-treatment with antimicrobials was associated with post-primary education (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.22-3.16, p=0.005), younger age (43.1 vs 48.7 years, p=0.007) and higher socioeconomic status score (0.42 vs 0.34, p=0.023). Conclusions Self-treatment with antimicrobials in an area of low malaria transmission intensity was uncommon and self-treatment with antihypertensives and antihyperglycemics was rare.

N2  - Female mosquitoes feed on blood from vertebrates, including humans, as a protein source to provision eggs. Through blood feeding, mosquitoes may transmit pathogens to humans and other animals. In diseases like malaria and dengue, humans are the main hosts and mosquitoes that preferentially feed on humans transmit the pathogens. We know relatively less about mosquitoes that switch between different vertebrate hosts and their underlying physiologic to utilize blood from different vertebrate hosts. Our study focuses on the Southern house mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus Say (Diptera: Culicidae), a vector that opportunistically feeds on birds and mammals when available, increasing the probability of transmitting bird pathogens to humans. Key factors examined encompassed gut physiology and reproductive fitness associated with switching host blood source. Our results indicate that the gut microbiome of Cx. quinquefasciatus is dynamic in response to switching between food sources and that blood meal source affects her macronutrient stores and reproductive output. This research will help advance our understanding of the effects of host blood source on important life history parameters for this mosquito vector to add to our understanding of the interaction between mosquito vectors and vertebrate hosts.

N2  - Equine piroplasmosis, caused by Theileria equi and Babesia caballi, is an economically important tick-borne disease worldwide. In the current study, 242 blood samples were randomly collected from horses in Zhangye city of Gansu province, China. The presence and genetic diversity of piroplasms were evaluated with a nested PCR assay, gene sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. The results showed that seventy-five (31.0%) samples were positive for piroplasms. Sequences analysis showed that seventy-three (30.2%) were positive for T. equi, and seven (2.9%) for B. caballi, five of which (2.1%) were infected with T. equi and B. caballi. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two T. equi genotypes (C and E) and one B. caballi genotype (A). The molecular epidemiological and genetic diversity results provide important epidemiological data for control of equine piroplasmosis caused by T. equi and B. caballi in China.

N2  - Fever is a regulated increase of the body temperature resulting from both infectious and non-infectious causes. Fever is known to play a role in modulating immune responses to infection, but the potential of febrile temperatures in regulating antigen binding affinity to antibodies has not been explored. Here we investigated this process under in vitro conditions using Isothermal titration calorimetry and ELISA. We used selected malarial and dengue antigens against specific monoclonal antibodies, and observed a marked increase in the affinity of these antibody-antigen complexes at 40°C, compared to physiological (37°C) or pathophysiological temperatures (42°C). Induced thermal equilibration of the protein partners at these temperatures in vitro, prior to measurements, further increased their binding affinity. These results suggest another positive and adaptive role for fever in vivo, and highlight the favourable role of thermal priming in enhancing protein-protein affinity for samples with limited availability.

N2  - Dourine, caused by Trypanosoma equiperdum, is a life-threatening venereal disease in equidae. So far, there is no clear evidence on how and when stallions become infectious, nor which tissues are affected by the parasite in diseased animals. Post-infection, after a transient, temporary phase of parasitaemia, the parasite disperses to different tissues in an unknown distribution pattern. This study describes the distribution of the parasite after infection by artificial insemination (AI) or blood transfusion. Mares (N = 4) were artificially inseminated with T. equiperdum spiked semen whereas stallions (N = 4) were infected by blood transfusion. The course of the disease was monitored by parasitological (Woo) and molecular (PCR) tests and clinical signs and haematological parameters were recorded. At 120 days post infection, horses had a full necropsy, histopathology and PCR. A similar pattern of parasitaemia, disease progression and tissue distribution were seen in all horses. Ejaculated semen in the preclinical stage and epididymal semen in the chronic stage of the disease was positive on PCR and caused infection in mice. Cymelarsan® treatment in the chronic stage did not result in a clinico-haematological or histopathological improvement. At necropsy, lesions were observed in the nervous and reproductive system. Histopathological lesions were most severe in the peripheral nerves and associated ganglia, the testicles and genital mucosae with multifocal infiltration of lymphocytes, plasma cells and histocytes. The parasites disseminated to several tissues including the nervous system, testicles and semen. The results indicate that transmission of T. equiperdum is possible through semen even from symptomless stallions post-treatment.

N2  - Objective Introduction: Malaria is an infectious disease caused by protozoa of the genus Plasmodium and it is transmitted by the bite of the female mosquito Anopheles. It is endemic in Africa, Asia, Oceania, Central and South America. There are 5 types of Malaria, being the most frequent those produced by P. Falciparum (60%) and P Vivax (35%). Severe malaria is caused by 1% of P Falciparum infections. The complications are neurologi-cal, renal, hematological (DIC), respiratory (ARDS). Treatment with ECMO becomes a therapeutic option in cases of severe malaria and ARDS with multi-organ dysfunction and refractory hypoxemia. Objective: To present 3 clinical cases of national and international patients with severe ARDS secondary to malaria infection, who required support in ECMO in FCV, requiring support from the site of origin. Methodology: A search was made of the ECMO VAD group database of the FCV, finding 3 cases of ECMO in complicated malaria, reviewing medical records and presenting results at hospital discharge. Case 1 A 15-year-old patient, from an endemic area of malaria, on a 5-day postoperative day of cesarean with a 28-week pregnancy and a clinical picture of 6 months of intermittent fever, with severe ARDS with Plasmodium Vivax infection, received ECMO VV for 92 days. Case 2 A 44-year-old patient of Chinese origin, travelling from Africa got sick in Curazao. He was suffering from severe ARDS with Plasmodium falciparum infec-tion, received ECMO VV for 13 days. Case 3 A 48-year-old patient travellingfrom Africa who was suffering from severe ARDS with Plasmodium fal-ciparum infection received ECV VV for 5 days. Conclusions: The 3 patients received mechanical venti-latory support for more than 4 days before cannulation, came from endemic areas of malaria, received antima-larial treatment. The venovenous vein in severe ARDS associated with multiorganic dysfunction in severe malaria must be established in a timely manner. The 3 patients survived the discharge. The ECMO allowed a better hemodynamic behavior favoring the reversion of the organic dysfunction, correcting the hypoxemia and avoiding the injury associated with the ventilation.

N2  - Leishmania donovani exposure often results in subclinical infection in immunocompetent individuals, and the factors dictating development of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) are not known. Infection with intestinal worms skew immunity towards type 2 and regulatory responses, thereby theoretically increases susceptibility to intracellular infections controlled by type 1 responses. Here we have tested how chronic infection with the intestinal nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus affected immunity to a secondary infection with L donovani. We found that mice infected with H polygyrus displayed higher Leishmania burden in liver and spleen compared to worm-free animals. This increased infectious load was accompanied by reduced leucocyte infiltration and nos2 transcription in livers and increased il4 and il10 transcription in spleens. Collectively, these data show that chronic infection with intestinal nematodes skew immune responses in a way that may favour development of VL.

N2  - Efficiently tracking and anticipating the dynamics of infectious agents in wild populations requires the gathering of large numbers of samples, if possible at several locations and points in time, which can be a challenge for some species. Testing for the presence of specific maternal antibodies in egg yolks sampled on the colonies could represent an efficient way to quantify the exposure of breeding females to infectious agents, particularly when using an abundant and widespread species, such as the yellow-legged gull (Larus michahellis). We used such an approach to explore spatio-temporal patterns of exposure to Toxoplasma gondii, a pathogenic protozoan responsible of toxoplasmosis in humans and other warm-blooded vertebrates. First, we tested the validity of this approach by exploring the repeatability of the detection of specific antibodies at the egg level using two different immunoassays and at the clutch level using an occupancy model. Then, samples gathered in 15 colonies from France, Spain and Tunisia were analysed using an immunoassay detecting antibodies specifically directed against T. gondii. Prevalence of specific antibodies in eggs was overall high while varying significantly among colonies. These results revealed that T. gondii circulated at a large spatial scale in the western Mediterranean yellow-legged gull population, highlighting its potential role in the maintenance community of this parasite. Additionally, this study illustrates how species commensal to human populations like large gulls can be used as wildlife sentinels for the tracking of infectious agents at the human-wildlife interface, notably by sampling eggs.

N2  - Hypereosinophilic syndromes are rare in children. Sporadic, mild-severity FIP1L1-platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα) rearrangement cases have been reported, mainly in boys. We present the case of a 5-year-old girl referred from her African country of birth, due to severe constitutional symptoms, multifocal bone pain, headache, gastrointestinal complaints, cardiomyopathy and unexplained hypereosinophilia. She presented multiple end-organ diseases and striking bone involvement. Although she had a positive serology for Strongyloides stercoralis, extensive evaluation detected a FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion gene. Systemic corticosteroids and low-dose imatinib were started and the child became asymptomatic. After 9 months of treatment, FIP1L1-PDGFRA was no longer detected.

N2  - Saliva is a complex matrix that reflects hormonal, immunological, metabolic and nutritional state of a person. Moreover, it is considered the most appropriate biological fluid for scientific investigations regarding ethics. Saliva chemistry is an emerging field and mostly employed in toxicology and forensic medicine for analysing and detecting user drug addiction and alcohol abuse by mapping the blood and saliva data. The advantages of salivary testing include helping in the diagnosis, prognosis and surveillance of disease, alongside with the non-invasive and ease of collection properties. The need for fast, cost-effective and reliable methods for saliva investigation has led to high technological advances in developing sensing tools. Hence, increasing number of papers are reporting diseases signalling salivary biomarkers for local or systemic pathologies like oral cancer, endocrine and immunologic pathologies, infectious and neurological diseases etc. This review focuses on the recent advances and main challenges employed in the detection and quantification of salivary biomarkers by separation, immunological and electrochemical techniques and highlight the future perspectives of the point-of-care devices in diagnosing local or systemic pathologies.

N2  - Background: Arboviruses (Zika, dengue and chikungunya) represent a major risk for pregnant women, especially because their vertical transmission can lead to neurological damage in newborns. Early diagnosis can be difficult due to similar clinical presentation with other congenital infections that are associated with congenital abnormalities. Objectives: To investigate the circulation of arboviruses and other pathogens responsible for congenital infections, reporting clinical aspects and geographic distribution of maternal rash in a metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro (Brazil). Methods: Cross-sectional study with pregnant women presenting rash attended at the Exanthematic Diseases Unit (Niterói, Rio de Janeiro) from 2015 to 2018. Diagnosis of arboviruses was performed by real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) and laboratorial screening for syphilis, toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus and HIV was assessed. Demographic data was used for georeferencing analysis. Findings: We included 121 pregnant women, of whom Zika virus was detected in 45 cases (37.2%), chikungunya in 33 (27.3%) and dengue in one (0.8%). Five patients presented syphilis, and we observed one case each of listeria, cytomegalovirus, and a syphilis-toxoplasmosis case. Similarity of clinical symptoms was observed in all groups; however, 84.8% of patients with chikungunya presented arthralgia. Following the decline of Zika cases, chikungunya infection was mostly observed during 2017–2018. Considering pregnant women infected with arboviruses and other infections, 41% resided in urban slums, mostly in Niterói. Main conclusions: Simultaneous circulation of arboviruses and other agents responsible for congenital infections were observed; however, we did not identify co-infections between arboviruses. In this scenario, we emphasize the importance of adequate prenatal care to provide an accurate diagnosis of maternal rash.

N2  - Purpose: Psychosocial stress has been associated with susceptibility to many infectious pathogens. We evaluated the association between perceived stress and incident sexually transmitted infections (STIs; Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Trichomonas vaginalis genital infections) in a prospective study of women. Stress may increase vulnerability to STIs by suppressing immune function and altering the protective vaginal microbiota. Methods: Using the 1999 Longitudinal Study of Vaginal Flora (n = 2439), a primarily African American cohort of women, we fitted Cox proportional hazards models to examine the association between perceived stress and incident STIs. We tested bacterial vaginosis (measured by Nugent Score) and sexual behaviors (condom use, number of partners, and partner concurrence) as mediators using VanderWeele's difference method. Results: Baseline perceived stress was associated with incident STIs both before and after adjusting for confounders (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.015; 95% confidence interval, 1.005–1.026). Nugent score and sexual behaviors significantly mediated 21% and 65% of this adjusted association, respectively, and 78% when included together in the adjusted model. Conclusions: This study advances understanding of the relationship between perceived stress and STIs and identifies high-risk sexual behaviors and development of bacterial vaginosis—both known risk factors for STIs—as mechanisms underlying this association.

N2  - Six years after the first edition of The Guideline for Gynecological Practice, which was jointly edited by The Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology and The Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the third revised edition was published in 2017. The 2017 Guidelines includes 10 additional clinical questions (CQ), which brings the total to 95 CQ (12 on infectious disease, 28 on oncology and benign tumors, 27 on endocrinology and infertility and 28 on healthcare for women). Currently a consensus has been reached on the Guidelines and therefore the objective of this report is to present the general policies regarding diagnostic and treatment methods used in standard gynecological outpatient care that are considered appropriate. At the end of each answer, the corresponding recommendation level (A, B, C) is indicated.

N2  - Objectives: Our objective is to report a clinical case as the first oral manifestation of this systemic disease. Case Report: A 76-year-old female in treatment with Aldactone and Bisoprolol due to a liver and heart failure of unknown origin, came to the clinic with acute pain with a month of evolution in the upper maxilla accompanied by fatigue and inappetence. Clinical exami-nation shows an extensive area of inflammation and necrosis with fibrous consistency, slightly indurated to the touch, in the edentu-lous area from 15 to 25. Also in the inferior jaw there were similar lesions. After the histopathological examination, the diagnostic of Leishmaniasis was established, which was subsequently found to be the cause of the systemic disease that the patient had had for several years. Results and Conclusions: Leishmaniasis is an infectious disease caused by the bite of the female sand flies. Systemic or visceral leishmaniasis appears 2-8 months after the bite. Oral lesions are often confused with other oral pathologies, which sometimes causes the diagnosis and its treatment to be delayed. The patient in spite of the treatment, died several months after the diagnosis of Leishmaniasis.

N2  - Introduction: Glioblastoma Multiforme (GBM) is a fast growing glioma that develops from start shaped glial cells. Most common presenting symptoms include, headache (50-60%), seizures (20-50%), focal neurologic symptoms such as memory loss, motor weakness, visual symptoms, language deficit, and cognitive and personality changes (10-40%) GBMs are aggressive, mostly resis-tant to therapy, and carry a corresponding poor prognosis. Exclusive periventricular involvement is extremely rare. Consequently periven-tricular GBM is easy to misdiagnose. Case Description: 54 year old male was brought to ED by family with complains of head-ache, memory problems, confusion and personality changes for 2.5 weeks. He was admitted to another hospital 3 days prior with similar complaints. At the time labs were normal & CT head without contrast revealed ventriculomegaly. Neurology was consulted and patient had MOCA 23/30 with deficits in recall and serial 7s, and his memory changes were suspected to be due to stress. He was discharged with recommendation to follow up with memory specialist. As patient's symptoms worsened family brought him to ED for second opinion. Initial dementia workup i.e. TSH, B12, RPR, HIV were normal. CT head unchanged from 3 days ago. MRI revealed multilobulated cystic lesion with rim enhancement in the right occipital horn. Extensive infectious workup remained negative and he was intermittently treated for TB & neurocysticercosis with no improvement. Patient's mental status however continued to worsen and he became more confused with visual hallucinations, gait instability & new onset seizure episodes. He developed hydrocephalus requiring left frontal external ventricular drain. Initial biopsy of ventricular lesion was inconclusive. Multiple repeat MRI and CT brain remained unchanged. Repeat biopsy was done and revealed aggressive glioblastoma multiforme with rare periventricular presentation. Patient expired in hospice 2 months after initial presentation. Discussion: GBM usually presents with headache and focal deficits are common. MRI reveals ring enhancing lesions. Our patient had rare presentation with imaging that was not typical for GBM. Additionally, he did not have any focal deficits and presented initially with personality changes. Above case emphasizes the need to consider periventricular GBM when more common etiologies have been ruled out, especially in healthy young adults with rapidly deteri-orating mental status.

N2  - In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) allows non-invasive imaging of the living human cornea, specifically enabling the detection of immune cells in the healthy and diseased ocular anterior segment. Studies using IVCM have provided insight into the effects of contact lens wear on corneal Langerhans cell density and morphology, and the effects of eye drops on conjunctiva-associated lymphoid tissue. IVCM has also been shown to be a useful adjunctive diagnostic tool in distinguishing infective and non-infective uveitis and in diagnosing atypical infective keratitis. In the research setting, this technology has enhanced our understanding of the role of inflammatory cells in corneal neuropathy and angiogenesis. In vivo-ex vivo correlation using animal models has helped overcome some of the difficulties in identifying cell type on IVCM images. As highlighted in this review, currently there are multiple established, and emerging, clinical and research applications for IVCM in the inflamed anterior segment.

N2  - Ongoing debate over the relationship between biodiversity and disease risk underscores the need to develop a more mechanistic understanding of how changes in host community composition influence parasite transmission, particularly in complex communities with multiple hosts. A key challenge involves determining how motile parasites select among potential hosts and the degree to which this process shifts with community composition. Focusing on interactions between larval amphibians and the pathogenic trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae, we designed a novel, large-volume set of choice chambers to assess how the selectivity of free-swimming infectious parasites varied among five host species and in response to changes in assemblage composition (four different permutations). In a second set of trials, cercariae were allowed to contact and infect hosts, allowing comparison of host-parasite encounter rates (parasite choice) with infection outcomes (successful infections). Cercariae exhibited consistent preferences for specific host species that were independent of the community context; large-bodied amphibians, such as larval bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana), exhibited the highest level of parasite attraction. However, because host attractiveness was decoupled from susceptibility to infection, assemblage composition sharply affected both per-host infection as well as total infection (summed among co-occurring hosts). Species such as the non-native R. catesbeiana functioned as epidemiological 'sinks’ or dilution hosts, attracting a disproportionate fraction of parasites relative to the number that established successfully, whereas Taricha granulosa and especially Pseudacris regilla supported comparatively more metacercariae relative to cercariae selection. These findings provide a framework for integrating information on parasite preference in combination with more traditional factors such as host competence and density to forecast how changes within complex communities will affect parasite transmission.

N2  - Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) ultimately plays a critical role in macrophage functions used against infectious agents. The present study investigated whether changes in G6PDH activity could influence the resistance of infected macrophages against Leishmania major infection. Mouse peritoneal and J774 macrophages were infected, respectively, ex vivo and in vitro, with L. major and then exposed to an inhibitor (6-aminonicotinamide) or activator (LPS + melatonin) of G6PDH activity for 24 h. Cell viability [using MTT assay] was measured to assess any direct toxicity from the doses of inhibitor/activator used for the macrophage treatments. Nitric oxide (NO) produced by the cells and released into culture supernatants was measured (Griess method) and cell G6PDH activity was also determined. Moreover, the number of amastigotes form Leishmania in macrophages that developed over a 7-d period was evaluated. The results showed that an increase in G6PDH activity after treatment of both types of macrophages with a combination of LPS + melatonin caused significant increases in NO production and cell resistance against L. major amastigote formation/survival. However, exposure to 6-aminonicotinamide led to remarkable suppression of G6PDH activity and NO production, events that were associated with a deterioration in cell resistance against (and an increase in cell levels of) the parasites. The results suggested that activation or suppression of G6PDH activity could affect leishmanicidal function of both mouse peritoneal and J774 macrophages. Thus, regulation of macrophages via modulation of G6PDH activity appears to provide a novel window for those seeking to develop alternative therapies for the treatment of leishmaniasis.

N2  - Background: Control of snail intermediate hosts has been proved to be a fast and efficient approach for interrupting the transmission of schistosomiasis. Some plant extracts have shown obvious molluscicidal activity, and a new compound Luo-Wei, also named tea-seed distilled saponin (TDS), was developed based on the saponins extracted from Camellia oleifera seeds. We aimed to test the molluscicidal activity of 4% TDS against the intermediate host snails in China and Egypt, and evaluate its environmental safety to non-target organisms. Methods: In the laboratory, Oncomelania hupensis, Biomphalaria alexandrina and Bulinus truncatus were exposed to 4% TDS, and the median lethal concentration (LC50) was estimated at 24, 48 and 72 h. In the field, snail mortalities were assessed 1, 2, 3 and 7 d post-immersion with 2.5 g/m3 4% TDS and 1, 3, 7 and 15 d post-spraying with 5 g/m2 4% TDS. In addition, the acute toxicity of 4% TDS to Japanese quail (Coturnix japonica), zebrafish (Brachydanio rerio) and freshwater shrimp (Macrobrachium nipponense) was assessed by estimations of LC50 or median lethal dose (LD50). Results: In the laboratory, the LC50 values of 4% TDS for O. hupensis were 0.701, 0.371 and 0.33 mg/L at 24, 48 and 72 h, respectively, and 4% TDS showed a 0.33 mg/L 24 h LC50 against B. alexandrina, and a 1.396 mg/L 24 h LC50 against B. truncatus. Across all study regions, the pooled mortalities of O. hupensis were 72, 86, 94 and 98% at 1, 2, 3 and 7 d, following field immersion of 4% TDS at a dose of 2.5 g/m3, and were 69, 77, 85 and 88% at 1, 3, 7 and 15 d, following field spraying at 5 g/m2, respectively. 4% TDS had moderate toxicity to Japanese quail (7 d LD50 > 60 mg/kg) and to shrimp (96 h LC50 = 6.28 mg/L; 95% CI: 3.53-11.2 mg/L), whereas its toxicity to zebrafish was high (96 h LC50 = 0.15 mg/L; 95% CI: 0.14-0.17 mg/L). Conclusions: 4% TDS is active against O. hupensis, B. alexandrina and B. truncatus under laboratory and field conditions, and it may be a candidate molluscicide of plant origin.

N2  - The seasonal abundance of Haemaphysalis longicornis Neumann and H. flava Neumann (Acari: Ixodidae) was monitored from 2015 through 2017 in Gyeonggi-do, South Korea. The hard ticks were surveyed monthly using CO2 bait traps from April to November and flagging from July to September in a coniferous forest, a deciduous forest, shrubs, and a grassland vegetation types. Haemaphysalis longicornis and H. flava were most abundant in the grassland and shrubs, which yielded over 50% of the total number of ticks in all 3 yr. Furthermore, H. longicornis comprised up to 90% of the ticks collected. Generally, peaks of nymph, adult, and larva numbers were observed from April to June, from June to July, and from August to September, respectively. Half of the ticks were pooled and tested for the presence of the SFTS virus with negative results.

N2  - Background: With the closure of the Three Gorges Dam in 2003 the hydrology of Poyang Lake was altered dramatically leading to significant changes in the environment. In order to assess the impact on schistosomiasis this study assessed the spatial and temporal patterns of the snail intermediate host, Oncomelania hupensis in the Poyang Lake tributaries. The results of the study have important implications for future snail control strategies leading to disease elimination. Methods: The marshland area surrounding Poyang Lake was divided randomly into 200 × 200 m vector grids using ArcGIS software, and the surveyed grids were randomly selected by the software. The snail survey was conducted in each selected grid using a survey frame of 50 × 50 m with one sideline of each grid serving as the starting line. No less than ten frames were used in each surveyed grid with Global Positioning System (GPS) recordings for each. All snails in each frame were collected to determine infection status by microscopy. Altitude data for all frames were extracted from a lake bottom topographic map in order to analyze the average altitude. All snail survey data were collected and statistically analyzed with SPSS 20.0 software in order to determine the difference of the percentage of frames with living snails and mean density of living snails in different regions of Poyang Lake. The altitude of the snail-infested marshlands and snail dens were subsequently identified. Results: A total of 1159 potential snail sampling grids were surveyed, of which 15 231 frames (0.1 m2/frame) were investigated. 1241 frames had live Oncomelania snails corresponding to 8.15% of the total number of frames. The mean density of living snails was 0.463/0.1 m2 with a maximum of 57 snails per frame. The percent of frames with snails in the southern sector (8.13%) of Poyang Lake did not differ statistically from the north (8.21%). However, the mean density of live snails in the northern sector (0.164/0.1 m2) of the lake was statistically higher (F = 6.727; P = 0.010) than the south (0.141/0.1 m2). In the south of the lake, the elevation of snail-inhabited marshland ranged between 11 - 16 m, and could be further subdivided into two snail-concentrated belts at 12-13 m of elevation and 15-16 m of elevation respectively. In the north of the lake, the elevation of snail-inhabited marshland ranged between 9- 16 m with the elevation of 12-14 m being the snail-concentrated zone. Conclusions: The elevation of snail-infested marshlands in the Poyang Lake region ranged from 9 to 16 m. The snail distribution and habitat has moved north of the lake and to a lower altitude due to changes in the water level post dam closure. Based on the current geological features of the snail habitant focused mollusciciding should occur in snail dense northern regions with frequent bovine and human traffic. Targeting these identified 'hotspots' of transmission will assist in elimination efforts.

N2  - Introduction: Diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection particularly its occult form requires monitoring and repeat serological and molecular studies. The aim of the study was to investigate the possible relation between the case of a family outbreak of hepatitis A and the finding that a member of this family was diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B. Methodology: A mother and her two sons, one previously diagnosed with chronic HBV infection, were hospitalized due to suspected acute hepatitis. Serological markers for hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis C were assessed. Additionally, HBV DNA was tested with a sensitive PCR. Hepatitis B vaccine was administered to the mother to differentiate resolved from occult HBV infection. Results: A family outbreak of hepatitis A was confirmed, alongside a focus of chronic HBV infection. The serological profile for two brothers was HBsAg(+), anti-HBcIgM(-), anti-HBc(+), HBcAg(-)/anti-HBe(+). The mother was negative for all HBV markers except anti-HBc. HBV DNA was detected at a level of 461 IU/mL in the elder brother, 3647 IU/mL in the younger brother and was negative in the mother on two occasions. Her anti-HBc alone, having two sons with chronic HBV infection, and her lack of antibody response to hepatitis B vaccine despite being negative for HBV DNA, led to the diagnosis of probable occult HBV infection. Conclusion: Our results confirmed that a vaccination approach could facilitate diagnosis of chronic HBV infection in the presence of isolated anti-HBc. If it were not for a family outbreak of hepatitis A, this unexpected family HBV focus would not have been revealed.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Insecticide resistance poses a serious threat to insecticide-based interventions in Africa. There is a fear that resistance escalation could jeopardize malaria control efforts. Monitoring cases of aggravation of resistance intensity and its impact on the efficacy of control tools is crucial to predict consequences of resistance. METHODS: The resistance levels of an Anopheles funestus population from Palmeira in southern Mozambique was characterised and its impact on the efficacy of various insecticide-treated nets established. RESULTS: A dramatic loss of efficacy of all long lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) including PBO-based nets (Olyset Plus) was observed. This An. funestus population consistently (2016, 2017 and 2018) exhibited high degree of pyrethroid resistance. Molecular analyses revealed that this resistance escalation was associated with a massive over-expression of duplicated cytochrome P450 genes, CYP6P9a/b and also the fixation of the resistance CYP6P9a_R allele in this population in 2016 (100%) in contrast to 2002 (5%). However, the low recovery of susceptibility after PBO synergist assay suggests that other resistance mechanisms could be involved. CONCLUSIONS: The loss of efficacy of pyrethroid-based LLINs with and without PBO is a concern for the effectiveness of insecticide-based intervention and action should be taken to prevent the spread of such super-resistance.

N2  - BACKGROUND: Symptomatic infection with pinworm (Enterobius vermicularis), a human pathogen, is clinically relevant in Germany, with an estimated prevalence in childhood of 2-20%. Enterobiasis can cause major mental distress. There is little systematically verified knowledge on the treatment of this condition, and there is no corresponding German guideline. This review is, therefore, intended as a summary of the current state of knowledge. METHODS: This review is based on pertinent publications retrieved by a selective search in PubMed for literature appearing from 1 January 1990 to 5 February 2019 and containing the search terms "enterobiasis," "oxyuriasis," "Enterobius vermicula- ris," "pinworm," and "threadworm." RESULTS: More than one billion people worldwide are thought to be infected with pinworm. Estimates of its prevalence among kindergarten and primary-school pupils in Europe are generally near 20%. Infants (<2 years of age), adolescents (>14 years of age), and adults are only sporadically affected. The main risk factors are age 4-11 years, uncontrolled anus-finger-mouth contact, nail-biting (onychophagia/peri- onychophagia), unsupervised body hygiene, and poor compliance with basic hand hygiene. No large-scale, randomized, controlled trials of treatment are available. The approved antihelminthic agents are mebendazole, pyrantel embonate, and pyrvinium embonate (success rates up to >90%). For recurrent infections, prolonged treatment for up to 16 weeks (a "pulse scheme") is recommended. CONCLUSION: In nearly all cases, antihelminthic treatment along with attention to hygienic measures can successfully eradicate pinworm infection and prevent recurrence and autoinfection. The involvement of all persons living in the patient's house- hold, including sexual partners, is a prerequisite to the lasting success of treatment.

N2  - Land-use changes can impact infectious disease transmission by increasing spatial overlap between people and wildlife disease reservoirs. In Malaysian Borneo, increases in human infections by the zoonotic malaria Plasmodium knowlesi are hypothesised to be due to increasing contact between people and macaques due to deforestation. To explore how macaque responses to environmental change impact disease risks, we analysed movement of a GPS-collared long-tailed macaque in a knowlesi-endemic area in Sabah, Malaysia, during a deforestation event. Land-cover maps were derived from satellite-based and aerial remote sensing data and models of macaque occurrence were developed to evaluate how macaque habitat use was influenced by land-use change. During deforestation, changes were observed in macaque troop home range size, movement speeds and use of different habitat types. Results of models were consistent with the hypothesis that macaque ranging behaviour is disturbed by deforestation events but begins to equilibrate after seeking and occupying a new habitat, potentially impacting human disease risks. Further research is required to explore how these changes in macaque movement affect knowlesi epidemiology on a wider spatial scale.

N2  - Background: Historically, malaria had been a widespread disease in China. A national plan was launched in China in 2010, aiming to eliminate malaria by 2020. In 2017, no indigenous cases of malaria were detected in China for the first time. To provide evidence for precise surveillance and response to achieve elimination goal, a comprehensive study is needed to determine the changing epidemiology of malaria and the challenges towards elimination. Methods: Using malaria surveillance data from 2011 to 2016, an integrated series of analyses was conducted to elucidate the changing epidemiological features of autochthonous and imported malaria, and the spatiotemporal patterns of malaria importation from endemic countries. Results: From 2011 to 2016, a total of 21,062 malaria cases with 138 deaths were reported, including 91% were imported and 9% were autochthonous. The geographic distribution of local transmission have shrunk dramatically, but there were still more than 10 counties reporting autochthonous cases in 2013-2016, particularly in counties bordering with countries in South-East Asia. The importation from 68 origins countries had an increasing annual trend from Africa but decreasing importation from Southeast Asia. Four distinct communities have been identified in the importation networks with the destinations in China varied by origin and species. Conclusions: China is on the verge of malaria elimination, but the residual transmission in border regions and the threats of importation from Africa and Southeast Asia are the key challenges to achieve and maintain malaria elimination. Efforts from China are also needed to help malaria control in origin countries and reduce the risk of introduced transmission.

N2  - Transgenic Anopheles gambiae Giles (Diptera: Culicidae) mosquitoes have been developed that confer sexual sterility on males that carry a transgene encoding a protein which cuts ribosomal DNA. A relevant risk concern with transgenic mosquitoes is that their capacity to transmit known pathogens could be greater than the unmodified form. In this study, the ability to develop two human pathogens in these transgenic mosquitoes carrying a homing endonuclease which is expressed in the testes was compared with its nontransgenic siblings. Infections were performed with Plasmodium falciparum (Welch) and o'nyong-nyong virus (ONNV) and the results between the transgenic and nontransgenic sibling females were compared. There was no difference observed with ONNV isolate SG650 in intrathoracic infections or the 50% oral infectious dose measured at 14 d postinfection or in mean body titers. Some significant differences were observed for leg titers at the medium and highest doses for those individuals in which virus titer could be detected. No consistent difference was observed between the transgenic and nontransgenic comparator females in their ability to develop P. falciparum NF54 strain parasites. This particular transgene caused no significant effect in the ability of mosquitoes to become infected by these two pathogens in this genetic background. These results are discussed in the context of risk to human health if these transgenic individuals were present in the environment.

N2  - We herein describe a case of Sweet's syndrome (SS) in a patient being treated for pulmonary toxoplasmosis complicated with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The patient's SS developed after the pulmonary toxoplasmosis improved following treatment. We searched his cytokine profiles comprehensively using a bead-based immunoassay. The results showed no elevation of IL-2, IFN-γ or IL-17A, and IL-6 was only observed to have increased at the onset of SS, suggesting that the pulmonary toxoplasmosis had been well controlled and that chronic inflammation may have been the cause of SS. Pulmonary toxoplasmosis is an extremely rare occurrence. The cytokine profile can help to clarify the pathological condition of SS and MDS complicated with severely invasive infectious diseases.
